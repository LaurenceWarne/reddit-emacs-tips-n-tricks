Don't try to replicate a static IDE setup, Emacs is fluid. \n2. Emacs Lisp is inevitable for Emacser to make this fluidity possible.\n3. Language-agnostic is better than language-specific. \n4. Embrace display-alist, fast window manipulation, winner-mode. \n5. .emacs.el reset every couple of years to accomodate innovation. \n6. Org-mode/org-roam for all documentation, projects, tips. The agenda is not set in stone. Use queries, filters, tweak, evolve things. \n7. A contextual dwim is always better than many keybindings. \n8. Use completion everywhere on everything (vertico is magic).  \n9. Contribute to the core and favourite packages.\n\nI am a beginner though, things might change."}, "ksifwh1": {"author": "geza42", "upvotes": 13, "body": "## u/geza42 [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1b20xgn/comment/ksifwh1) \n**Votes:** 13\n\nIf you use an LSP server with semantic highlighting, it's worth checking out the value of `font-lock-maximum-decoration`. For example, I use `c++-mode` with `lsp-mode` (with clangd), I decreased `font-lock-maximum-decoration` to `2`, and I didn't notice any highlighting difference (because the lost highlighting by `c++-mode` gets highlighted by `lsp-mode`), while `c++-mode` font-locking become faster (`c++-mode` 's font-locking works well 99.9% of the time, but sometimes it can become slow in some circumstances, these slowdowns seems to be gone).\n\nI use:`(setq font-lock-maximum-decoration '((c-mode . 2) (c++-mode . 2) (t . t)))`"}, "kslwb72": {"author": "LionyxML", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/LionyxML [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1b20xgn/comment/kslwb72) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nA blog post regarding my own Emacs config aiming to get the same user experience on both TUI and GUI.  \n[https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/lemacs](https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/lemacs)"}}
