Don't try to replicate a static IDE setup, Emacs is fluid. \n2. Emacs Lisp is inevitable for Emacser to make this fluidity possible.\n3. Language-agnostic is better than language-specific. \n4. Embrace display-alist, fast window manipulation, winner-mode. \n5. .emacs.el reset every couple of years to accomodate innovation. \n6. Org-mode/org-roam for all documentation, projects, tips. The agenda is not set in stone. Use queries, filters, tweak, evolve things. \n7. A contextual dwim is always better than many keybindings. \n8.

You can bookmark up to 9 places inside a file and jump to that position. The limitations is that if you add somehing above the bookmark the position is shifted a bit but it's not that hard to find the right place.\n\nIt works like this: `C-c 0` creates a bookmark and `C-c <1-9>` jumps into a bookmark.

But this doesn't work in Emacs, because the \"folding\" and \"narrow\" states of the buffer are synced between the windows in contrast to Vim. One concrete use case I had: I have a huge Org file, and wanted to narrow `C-x n s` into different headings of the file in different windows.\n\nIndirect buffers solve this. It makes two buffers for one file, and these buffers have separate settings for folding, narrowing, etc. But the buffer contents are still synced, so there's no risk of diverging file states.

Note, I just blindly copied some of the logic from `embark`, maybe there are some unnecessary things here.\n\n```elisp\n(defun my-embark-M-k (&optional arg)\n  (interactive \"P\")\n  (require 'embark)\n  (if-let ((targets (embark--targets)))\n      (let* ((target\n              (or (nth\n                  (if (or (null arg) (minibufferp))\n                      0\n                    (mod (prefix-numeric-value arg) (length targets)))\n                  targets)))\n            (type (plist-get target :type)))\n        (cond\n         ((eq type 'buffer)\n          (let ((embark-pre-action-hooks))\n            (embark--act 'kill-buffer target)))))))\n\n(define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd \"M-k\") 'my-embark-M-k)\n\n```\nI'm not sure whether these two can be achieved out-of-the box, but I didn't find these functionalities, so I created them."}, "j8m9rlj": {"author": "PriorOutcome", "upvotes": 20, "body": "## u/PriorOutcome [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112t0uo/comment/j8m9rlj) \n**Votes:** 20\n\nWith an active region, you can freely toggle between rectangle mark mode and normal, you don't need to get rid of your active region to switch between the two."}, "j8mo1bz": {"author": "noi-gai", "upvotes": 9, "body": "## u/noi-gai [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112t0uo/comment/j8mo1bz) \n**Votes:** 9\n\nPut the control keys next to space, mimicking mac's command key (which is effectively used as the equivalent of ctrl yet next to the space it's easier to press)\n\nWin - Alt - Ctrl - Space - Ctrl - Alt - Win"}, "j8u1ebf": {"author": "SlowValue", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/SlowValue [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112t0uo/comment/j8u1ebf) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nI put a couple of similar functions on my `<f5>` key (with all combinations of modifier keys) and tend to forget the meanings of those combinations.\n\nSo I made a small function to give some help for a list of keybindings.:\n\n```elisp\n(defun my-generate-keybind-doc-on-keys (&rest keys)\n  \"generate help on some given  keybindings (kbd style).\"\n  (substring\n   (apply #'concat\n          (mapcar #'(lambda (key)\n                      (let* ((fun (key-binding (kbd key)))\n                             (fun-name (symbol-name fun))\n                             (doc (documentation fun 'raw))\n                             (oneline (substring doc 0 (string-match \"\\n\" doc))))\n                        (put-text-property 0 (length key) 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face key)\n                        (put-text-property 0 (length fun-name) 'face 'font-lock-function-name-face fun-name)\n                        (put-text-property 0 (length oneline) 'face 'font-lock-doc-face oneline)\n                        (format \"%10s : %-30s \u2192 %s\\n\" key fun-name oneline)))\n                  keys))\n   0 -1))\n\n```\nTo show that help in the echo buffer, one needs to define a command, which can be bound to a key:\n\n```elisp\n(defun my-show-help-on-some-keys ()\n  \"demo generate help on 3 keys\"\n  (interactive)\n  (message (my-generate-keybind-doc-on-keys \"C-s\"\n                                            \"<f1> k\"\n                                            \"C-c !\")))\n\n```\nThen calling the command `my-show-help-on-some-keys`, shows following message in the echo buffer:\n\n```elisp\n   C-s : isearch-forward                \u2192 Do incremental search forward.\n<f1> k : helpful-key                    \u2192 Show help for interactive command bound to KEY-SEQUENCE.\n C-c ! : shell-here                     \u2192 Open a shell relative to default-directory.\n\n\n```\nRemark: I know that `which-key` exists, but I'm already above that level of knowledge and don't need `which-key` anymore."}, "ja41lso": {"author": "AnugNef4", "upvotes": 10, "body": "## u/AnugNef4 [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112t0uo/comment/ja41lso) \n**Votes:** 10\n\nHow I got my Info Directory node `C-h i` to display all my installed .info files living under `/opt/homebrew` on an M1 Mac.

The only key binding in `insert-pair-map` is for `[t]`, which means it is the default key binding and any key after the prefix will run the same command: `insert-pair`. Now, `insert-pair` looks at which key was used to invoke it and if it is an opening delimiter it inserts both it and the corresponding closing delimiter (and if the region is active it insert the opening delimiter at the start and the closing delimiter at the end, wrapping the region)."}, "j4ct1y1": {"author": "Nondv", "upvotes": 9, "body": "## u/Nondv [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/108zin2/comment/j4ct1y1) \n**Votes:** 9\n\nMaybe not new for anyone but I only recently found out that `C-c <any letter>` is conventionally reserved for user bindings.

I liked the post and had captured it for later and only now could process it properly.\n\nThe reasoning for using `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` is good, but pretty much everyone complained about their default bindings.\n\nIt is worth noting that Emacs 28 has included `repeat-mode` and Emacs 29 has added `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` to the repeat maps. So, if you're in Emacs 29, just enabling `repeat-mode` gets you a better behavior for this. You can start with `C-x <right>` and, after that, just the arrow keys get you to the next or previous buffer.\n\nIf you're still on Emacs 28, you can use:\n\n```elisp\n(defvar buffer-navigation-repeat-map\n  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))\n    (define-key map (kbd \"<right>\") 'next-buffer)\n    (define-key map (kbd \"<left>\") 'previous-buffer)\n    map)\n  \"Keymap to repeat `next-buffer' and `previous-buffer'.

However, I'm also a Gmail user, don't love it, but consider myself stuck with it (given budget constraints and it being my email for several years already). This makes me always weary of \"the next Google shenanigan\" which might break my workflow. One of the things I have learned to cherish about using `mu4e` is its integration with Org, with it's `org-capture` support, which enables me not to confuse my Inbox with my todo list, thus keeping my Inbox clean.

As a result I've also switched from flycheck and to flymake. One nice thing about flycheck is that it allowed for stacking checkers. When coding Python I liked to stack flake8 for styles and mypy for types (plus the LSP's since it's already there).\n\nFlymake allows for stacking checkers but it turns out eglot clobbers these checkers when \"adding\" the LSP's checker. To get stacked Flymake checkers with Eglot you can simply add them back after Eglot has done it's thing.\n\nFor example, here is a simple setup for Python which includes Pyright's type checking and flake8 style checking\n\n```elisp\n;; Use flake8 as the python style checker by default\n(setq python-flymake-command '(\"flake8\" \"-\"))\n    \n(use-package eglot\n  :hook ((python-mode . eglot-ensure)\n         (eglot-managed-mode\n\t  . (lambda ()\n\t      ;; re-enable flymake checkers because eglot clobbers\n\t      ;; them when starting\n\t      (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode)\n\t\t(add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions \n                          'python-flymake nil t)))))\n    \n  :custom\n  ;; shutdown server after killing last managed buffer\n  (eglot-autoshutdown t)\n  :bind\n  ((\"C-c l r\" . eglot-rename))\n  :config\n  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs\n               `(python-mode \"pyright-langserver\" \"-w\" \"--stdio\")))\n\n```\nNow all that's left is mypy. Flymake originally used a [\"Proc\"](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/flymake.html#The-legacy-Proc-backend) method for creating checkers which existing mypy ones use. So for a bonus tip & trick [I've written a mypy checker in the new style](http://github.com/com4/flymake-mypy). It can be enabled when using eglot like this:\n\n```elisp\n(use-package flymake-mypy\n  :straight (flymake-mypy\n             :type git\n             :host github\n             :repo \"com4/flymake-mypy\")\n  :hook ((eglot-managed-mode . (lambda ()\n\t\t\t\t (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode)\n\t\t\t\t   (flymake-mypy-enable))))))\n\n```\nAfter opening a Python buffer and executing `M-x flymake-running-backends` we are greeted with a list of stacked checkers: `Running backends: eglot-flymake-backend, flymake-mypy--run, python-flymake`."}, "ioeh1ly": {"author": "howardthegeek", "upvotes": 20, "body": "## u/howardthegeek [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xdw6ok/comment/ioeh1ly) \n**Votes:** 20\n\nI just learned that in eshell, $$ is replaced with the output from the last command."}, "iodig8c": {"author": "zupatol", "upvotes": 30, "body": "## u/zupatol [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xdw6ok/comment/iodig8c) \n**Votes:** 30\n\nAfter years of using emacs, I wrote my second ever elisp function to open on github the code I'm browsing in emacs.\n\n```elisp\n(defun open-on-github ()\n  (interactive)\n  (let\n      ((repo-url (magit-git-string \"remote\" \"get-url\" \"--push\" \"origin\"))\n       (commit-hash (magit-git-string \"rev-parse\" \"HEAD\"))\n       (start-line (if (use-region-p)\n                       (line-number-at-pos (region-beginning))\n                     (line-number-at-pos)))\n       (end-line (if (use-region-p) (line-number-at-pos (region-end)))))\n    (unless repo-url (error  \"not in a git repo\"))\n    (browse-url\n     (concat\n      (substring repo-url 0 -4)\n      \"/blob/\"\n      commit-hash\n      \"/\"\n      (substring buffer-file-name (length (projectile-project-root)))\n      \"#L\" (number-to-string start-line)\n      (if (and (use-region-p) (< 0 (- end-line start-line)))\n          (concat \"..L\" (number-to-string end-line)))\n      ))))\n```"}, "iodmtzu": {"author": "PriorOutcome", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/PriorOutcome [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xdw6ok/comment/iodmtzu) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nI find it pretty useful (for debugging etc) to override the default projectile mode line indicator and show the projectile project type of the buffer instead, which can be done pretty easily if you're a use-package user with https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/delight.html:\n\n```elisp\n(use-package projectile\n  :delight '(:eval (format \" P[%s]\" (projectile-project-type)))\n  :config\n  (setq foo \"bar\"))\n```"}, "innk62a": {"author": "kickingvegas1", "upvotes": 10, "body": "## u/kickingvegas1 [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/x7zfs2/comment/innk62a) \n**Votes:** 10\n\nTIL when working with an Org table that `S-RET` will fill the current cell value with the value above it. <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-03/msg00462.html>"}, "inqralq": {"author": "WorldsEndless", "upvotes": 10, "body": "## u/WorldsEndless [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/x7zfs2/comment/inqralq) \n**Votes:** 10\n\nI use follow-mode (built-in to #emacs) to split reading buffers across modern wide screens to use all the real estate.

I have a function which retrieves a biblatex entry corresponding to an url using zotra and adds a corresponding Org heading with the biblatex fields as properties, and the entry becomes available in Citar as soon as I save the document. Citing these entries then works anywhere, even in the same document with a suitable `#+bibliography: my-org-biblatex-file.org` declaration. Exporting the citations also works with the CSL exporter, no conversion is necessary to a proper biblatex bibliography file (but can be easily done if one needs biblatex-based export). Since the bibliography is an Org document, tagging, agenda commands, column view etc. can all be used with the bibliography entries.

The display of long lines has been optimized, and Emacs no longer chokes when a buffer on display contains long lines.  If you still experience slowdowns while editing files with long lines, this is either due to font locking, which you can turn off with M-x font-lock-mode or C-u C-x x f, or to the current major mode or one of the enabled minor modes, in which case you should open the the file with M-x find-file-literally instead of C-x C-f.  The variable 'long-line-threshold' controls whether and when these display optimizations are used.\n\nThat sounds like great news!

If that location is behind point (as it usually is if I notice the typo shortly after entering it), then `isearch-backward` works great. You press \"C-r\" and type some characters starting with your target until the location becomes the current result.  As soon as the cursor jumps to your target location, you can use an editing command like \"C-t\", which exits isearch automatically for you. Or you can press \"C-m\" to exit isearch-mode and then start inserting text at that location. Wonderful!\n\nBut it's a little less perfect when your target is *after* point. This is because with `isearch-forward`, point lands at the end of your search result, instead of the beginning as it does with `isearch-backward`.\n\nYou could type your search starting with some arbitrary number of characters in front of the target. But then you have to decide in advance how many characters to use, and if you don't use enough, there might be too many results. And then if you have to keep typing past your target character to sufficiently narrow the results, point won't land where you want it.\n\nAnother strategy would be to do the same thing as when searching backwards, start with the target character and just type characters until your target location is selected. But now point is at the other end of the result, instead of where you want it. \"M-b\" would exit and move point to the beginning of the word, but that assumes there are no word boundaries in your search result, and besides, your actual target won't always be the beginning of a word. Often it will be somewhere in the middle of a word.\n\nOr you could use C-r to move point to the beginning of the result. But then you still have to press C-m to exit the search and start inserting text at that location. And that's 2 key-presses just to finish your search, not to mention all the key-presses you did to start.\n\nSo we can fix this.\n\n# My Solution\n\n```elisp\n(defun my/isearch-bor-exit ()\n  \"Ensure point is at beginning of isearch result, then exit.\"\n  (interactive)\n  (when (< isearch-other-end (point))\n    (goto-char isearch-other-end))\n  (call-interactively 'isearch-exit))\n    \n(define-key isearch-mode-map ?\\M-m 'my/isearch-bor-exit)\n\n```\nSo now if I'm using isearch to get to a precise location (as opposed to just searching for a word), I can type beginning with the character at the target location, stop typing after it becomes part of the result, and press \"M-m\" to exit the search and make my correction. No more having to stop and think about whether I'm going backwards or forwards and whether I'll have to move point back before exiting isearch.\n\n# The Conclusion\n\nA minor problem with a fairly simple solution, but it made me happy to stop and solve it.\n\nI think I'll be using isearch now for a lot of things that I used to use Avy for.  But Avy is still great for a bunch of reasons. Not the least of which is the `avy-isearch` command which comes in handy when there are a lot of isearch results that would require too much typing to narrow down. (And it always puts point at the beginning of the result, never at the end)."}, "i3m1liu": {"author": "???", "upvotes": 22, "body": "## u/???

For example, eval this in your Emacs session:\n\n```elisp\n(define-short-documentation-group my-datetime\n  \"Querying current time\"\n  (current-time\n   :eval (current-time))\n  (float-time\n   :eval (float-time))\n  \n  \"Time formats\"\n  (time-convert\n   :eval (time-convert (current-time))\n   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'list)\n   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 100000)\n   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 200000)\n   :eval (time-convert (current-time) t)\n   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'integer))\n  \n  (float-time\n   :eval (float-time (current-time))))\n\n```\nAfter this, the `my-datetime` group will show as an option in `M-x shortdoc-display-group`. Additionally, if you view help for any of the functions mentioned above, the Help buffer will refer back to the `my-datetime` shortdoc group!\n\nThe example used here is a cheatsheet I just started writing for myself, as I've been researching the built-in time functions. For additional instructions on use, see `define-short-documentation-group` macro. For use examples, jump to the source of `define-short-documentation-group` and scroll down a bit - the default shortdoc groups are defined there."}, "i3mghuf": {"author": "PriorOutcome", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/PriorOutcome [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/txh85s/comment/i3mghuf) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nI wanted to be able to expand yasnippets within other yasnippets (so here tab would jump to the next position instead of trying to expand snippet), surprisingly all I had to do was:\n\n`:bind (\"C-<tab>\" . yas-expand)`\n\nSo C-<tab> expands a snippet within a snippet, and everything just worked as I'd hoped.

I also don't use line wrapping, as in code it usually looks misleading, so lines can sometimes exceed window width, either because of some long names or because the current window configuration is too narrow.\n\nHowever, when scrolling text sideways, there's a small annoyance that the scroll can go way too far to the left. E.g. if this is your window, and your text exceeds it:\n\n\n```elisp\n|Short line             |\n|Some really long line o|\n|Another short line     |\n\n```\nWhat I'd like to is to prevent scrolling any further than that:\n\n```elisp\n|line                   |\n|eally long line of text|\n|r short line           |\n\n```\nBut Emacs actually allows to scroll as far as one would want to, like here:\n\n```elisp\n|                       |\n|t                      |\n|                       |\n\n```\nThis doesn't make sense to me, as you can't see anything at all.\nProbably handy, when you write in really long lines, and you wish to have some buffer for adding more text without triggering scrolling, but I never needed that. So I wrote such predicate:\n\n```elisp\n(defun truncated-lines-p ()\n  \"Non-nil if any line is longer than `window-width' + `window-hscroll'.\n\nReturns t if any line exceeds the right border of the window.\nUsed for stopping scroll from going beyond the longest line.\nBased on `so-long-detected-long-line-p'.\"\n  (save-excursion\n    (goto-char (point-min))\n    (let* ((window-width\n            ;; this computes a more accurate width rather than `window-width', and respects\n            ;; `text-scale-mode' font width.\n            (/ (window-body-width nil t) (window-font-width)))\n           (hscroll-offset\n            ;; `window-hscroll' returns columns that are not affected by\n            ;; `text-scale-mode'.

Since there's no way to get unscaled value, we have to get\n            ;; a width of a face that is not scaled by `text-scale-mode', such as\n            ;; `window-divider' face.\n            (ceiling (/ (* (window-hscroll) (window-font-width nil 'window-divider))\n                        (float (window-font-width)))))\n           (line-number-width\n            ;; compensate line numbers width\n            (if (bound-and-true-p display-line-numbers-mode)\n                (- display-line-numbers-width)\n              0))\n           ;; subtracting 2 for extra space in case some calculations were imprecise\n           (threshold (+ window-width hscroll-offset line-number-width -2)))\n      (catch 'excessive\n        (while (not (eobp))\n          (let ((start (point)))\n            (save-restriction\n              (narrow-to-region start (min (+ start 1 threshold)\n                                           (point-max)))\n              (forward-line 1))\n            (unless (or (bolp)\n                        (and (eobp) (<= (- (point) start)\n                                        threshold)))\n              (throw 'excessive t))))))))\n\n```\nThis function can calculate window width, and line width, and check if any line in the buffer exceeds the window width screen-wise. By screen-wise I mean that if you've scrolled text to the left, it will begin to return `nil` once all lines don't exceed the right border of the window, thus achieving the described behavior in the diagrams.

You can see my thoughts in the function's comments. Any suggestions on how to make it more accurate?"}, "hr4bbl5": {"author": "hxlr666", "upvotes": 15, "body": "## u/hxlr666 [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/rvagin/comment/hr4bbl5) \n**Votes:** 15\n\nUse org capture"}, "hoqrg9e": {"author": "???", "upvotes": 9, "body": "## u/???

I sometimes have to fill out forms I get in PDF but that aren't fillable PDFs, merely scans of paper forms. I guess a reasonable person would install The Gimp or something like that, but I fill them out in LaTeX, using `\\includegraphics` for the PDF form, and the `textpos` package to place text on top of it. \n\nThis is requires giving the coordinates you want the text placed at, which I used to do by trial and error. And as much as I normally dislike the mouse, I had to admit that for specifying a point in an image it is a much better input device than the keyboard. So I decided to write a function that would let me click on a point in a PDF and insert the coordinates in centimeters at point in the current buffer. Writing it was fairly easy and I think really illustrates the power of a system like Emacs, a Lisp Machine or Smalltalk, where you can instantly find the source code implementing any given functionality. I knew that `pdf-tools` must contain some code to translate mouse clicks into PDF document coordinates, because it lets you place annotations by clicking. I have the text annotation function bound to `a t`, and quick `C-h k` later I was reading the source code. And after that writing the following function was pretty easy:\n\n```elisp\n(defun insert-coordinates ()\n  \"Insert coordinates (in centimeters) of mouse click.\"\n  (interactive)\n  (let ((pos (event-start (pdf-util-read-click-event \"Click on PDF\"))))\n    (insert\n     (with-selected-window (posn-window pos)\n       (let ((pt (pdf-util-scale-pixel-to-points (posn-object-x-y pos))))\n         (cl-flet ((f (x) (* 2.54 (/ x 72.0))))\n           (format \"(%.1fcm,%.1fcm)\" (f (car pt)) (f (cdr pt)))))))))\n```"}, "h9e6uqq": {"author": "github-alphapapa", "upvotes": 16, "body": "## u/github-alphapapa [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/p6mwx2/comment/h9e6uqq) \n**Votes:** 16\n\nHere's a popular Emacs config I just rediscovered.

But tabs are vastly inferior to Emacs' built in buffer management, and I don't think the abstraction belongs at the application level, instead it should be implemented once universally so it can be used with all applications. I think tabs became popular because window managers failed at effectively managing a large number of browser windows.\n\nI use Firefox with the tab bar hidden, and with an extension which will open every new tab in a new window automatically. Now I can use my buffer switching commands like usual, across the 100s of Firefox windows I have, and it works like a breeze. Whatever improvements I add to help me manage buffers, automatically apply to Firefox. For example I recently enabled `midnight-mode` to clean up old buffers that I haven't visited in a few days, and I now have this automatically for Firefox too (I'm bad at manually closing webpages once I open them).\n\nNow, onto my tip/trick. I wanted ibuffer to display the URL of each Firefox window as the file name. So I can search by the window name, or by the URL, while keeping them separated. The file name seems appropriate here as it would otherwise be empty.\n\nTo do this, I found an extension that adds the current URL to Firefox's title (I used https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepass-helper-url-in-title/, but any would work), I then wrote the following function:\n\n```elisp\n(defun b3n-exwm-set-buffer-name ()\n  (if (and exwm-title (string-match \"\\\\`http[^ ]+\" exwm-title))\n    (let ((url (match-string 0 exwm-title)))\n      (setq-local buffer-file-name url)\n      (setq-local exwm-title (replace-regexp-in-string\n                              (concat (regexp-quote url) \" - \")\n                              \"\"\n                              exwm-title))))\n\n  (setq-local exwm-title\n              (concat\n               exwm-class-name\n               \"<\"\n               (if (<= (length exwm-title) 50)\n                   exwm-title\n                 (concat (substring exwm-title 0 50) \"\u2026\"))\n               \">\"))\n\n  (exwm-workspace-rename-buffer exwm-title))\n\n```\nI then added this function to the `exwm-update-class-hook` and `exwm-update-title-hook` hooks.\n\nNow, in ibuffer, it looks like this:\n\n```elisp\n  Firefox<Weekly tips/trick/etc/ thread : emacs \u2014 Mozilla Fi\u2026> https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/mb8u1m/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/\n\n```\nWith the buffer name on the left, and the file name (URL) on the right. Perfect :)\n\nI will make some more improvements in the coming days, so if I split the window with `C-x 3` it duplicates the current window, so it works similar to a regular Emacs buffer and I can scroll to different points on the same page. EXWM should make this easy enough with simulation keys."}, "gpeb8n3": {"author": "b3n", "upvotes": 13, "body": "## u/b3n [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lvw44q/comment/gpeb8n3) \n**Votes:** 13\n\nHere's a nice eshell command:\n\n```elisp\n(defun eshell/history ()\n  (interactive)\n  (insert\n   (completing-read \"History: \" (delete-dups (ring-elements eshell-history-ring)))))\n\n```\nIt lets you use your normal completion framework to select an item from history.

We recently introduced styled components into our app and while they're very handy, not having proper css support inside rjsx-mode was pretty annoying. I was looking for solutions, maybe extending rjsx-mode, but I wasn't up to that task. I then realized the built-in emacs commands and buffers themselves could solve my problem! What I want is for css inside a styled component, which always looks something like this:\n\n```elisp\nconst myDiv = styled.div` // notice the backtick\n    Some css...\n ` // ending backtick\n\n```\nto *actually* use scss-mode when editing, and then return to rjsx-mode when finished. The elisp is very simple and leads to a trivial workflow:\n\n```elisp\n;; The following 2 functions allow editing styled components with all scss mode features.\n(defun edit-styled-component ()\n  (interactive)\n  (progn\n    (save-excursion\n      (let ((start (search-backward \"`\"))\n            (end (search-forward \"`\" nil nil 2))) ; second occurrence, since first is `start'\n        (narrow-to-region start end)))\n    (scss-mode)))\n\n(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'rjsx-mode\n  \"ms\" 'edit-styled-component)\n\n;; When editing is done, use the same key sequence to return to the original file.\n(defun return-from-styled-component ()\n  (interactive)\n  (progn\n    (widen)\n    (rjsx-mode)))\n\n(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'scss-mode\n  \"ms\" 'return-from-styled-component)\n\n\n```\nSo now when I edit a styled component I just hit **, m s**, which narrows the region to whatever is enclosed by backticks (i.e. all the css) and actually treats it as a bona fide css buffer, with all my snippets, completion, etc. Then when I'm done I just got **, m s** again to widen back to the original (rjsx) buffer!"}, "gj33uht": {"author": "jumpUpHigh", "upvotes": 9, "body": "## u/jumpUpHigh [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/kvmmq3/comment/gj33uht) \n**Votes:** 9\n\nAucTeX\n\nWhen you compile your TeX file and there are errors, the message asks you to see error messages using\n\n```elisp\n C-c `\n\n```\nThis leads to the last error which is sometimes incomprehensible and you are left to yourself to figure out what went wrong.\n\nInstead of getting the last error, you can get an overview of all the errors by setting below variable to `t`:\n\n```elisp\n (setq TeX-error-overview-open-after-TeX-run t)\n\n```\nYou can pop this up in a separate frame using:\n\n```elisp\n  (setq TeX-error-overview-setup 'separate-frame)\n\n```\nRelated docs are [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Error-overview.html).\n\nThis totally changes the way you can handle errors messages."}, "gj9ioly": {"author": "WorldsEndless", "upvotes": 10, "body": "## u/WorldsEndless [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/kvmmq3/comment/gj9ioly) \n**Votes:** 10\n\nJust a cool concept: if you have a keypad on your keyboard which you rarely use, bind its nums to something useful.

For example, if you start writing an `if` (cursor is `|`, the closing `)` was put by smartparens):\n\n```elisp\nif (expr|)\n\n```\nThen press M-RET, this will be the result:\n\n```elisp\nif (expr) {\n    |\n}\n\n```\nSince I created this function I use it all the time, I almost never press `{` `}` or `;`.\n\nAt function signatures, it cannot figure out whether you want to create a declaration (closed by `;`) or definition (closed by `{ }`), so it puts a `;`. And the function has a parameter (`force-curly`) with which you can force putting a`{` (I mapped this to M-S-return).\n\nHere's the code, maybe there can be a lot of improvements:\n\n```elisp\n(defun my-cc-mode-M-RET-context (force-curly)\n  (let ((c\n         (if force-curly 'curly\n           (let ((s (syntax-ppss)))\n             (cond\n              ((nth 4 s) 'comment)\n              ((and (eolp) (looking-back \"[{;]\")) 'nop)\n              ((save-excursion\n                 (skip-syntax-forward \" \")\n                 (looking-at \"\\\\(for\\\\|if\\\\|switch\\\\|else\\\\|do\\\\)\\s?\")) 'curly)\n              ((save-excursion\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \" \")\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \"w\")\n                 (looking-at \"\\\\(for\\\\|if\\\\|switch\\\\|else\\\\|do\\\\)\\s?\")) 'curly)\n              ((save-excursion\n                 (when (nth 3 s) (skip-syntax-backward \"^\\\"\") (backward-char))\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \" \")\n                 (if (looking-back \")\")\n                     (backward-sexp)\n                   (ignore-errors (backward-up-list)))\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \"(\")\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \" \")\n                 (looking-back \"for\\\\|if\\\\|switch\")) 'curly)\n              ((save-excursion\n                 (skip-syntax-forward \" \")\n                 (looking-at \"struct\\\\|class\")) 'curly+semicolon)\n              ((save-excursion\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \" \")\n                 (skip-syntax-backward \"w\")\n                 (if (looking-at \"struct\\\\|class\") t\n                   (skip-syntax-backward \"w\")\n                   (skip-syntax-backward \" \")\n                   (looking-back \"struct\\\\|class\"))) 'curly+semicolon)\n              (t 'semicolon))))))\n    (cond\n     ((or (eq c 'curly) (eq c 'curly+semicolon))\n      (save-excursion\n        (end-of-line)\n        (if (looking-back \"{\")\n            'nop\n          c)))\n     ((eq c 'semicolon)\n      (save-excursion\n        (end-of-line)\n        (if (looking-back \";\")\n            'nop\n          c)))\n     (t c))))\n    \n(defun my-cc-mode-M-RET (force-curly)\n  (let ((c (my-cc-mode-M-RET-context force-curly)))\n    (cond\n     ((eq c 'nop)\n      (if (save-excursion\n            (forward-line)\n            (beginning-of-line)\n            (looking-at-p \"[[:space:]]*$\"))\n          (progn\n            (forward-line)\n            (c-indent-line))\n      (end-of-line) (newline-and-indent)))\n     ((eq c 'comment) (newline-and-indent))\n     ((eq c 'semicolon)\n      (end-of-line)\n      (self-insert-command 1 ?\\;)\n      (newline-and-indent))\n     ((eq c 'curly)\n      (save-excursion (end-of-line) (unless (looking-back \"\\s\") (insert \" \")) (insert \"{\") (newline-and-indent) (insert \"}\") (c-indent-line))\n      (end-of-line)\n      (newline-and-indent))\n     ((eq c 'curly+semicolon)\n      (save-excursion (end-of-line) (unless (looking-back \"\\s\") (insert \" \")) (insert \"{\") (newline-and-indent) (insert \"};\") (c-indent-line))\n      (end-of-line)\n      (newline-and-indent)))))\n    \n(define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd \"M-RET\") (lambda () (interactive) (my-cc-mode-M-RET nil)))\n(define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd \"<M-S-return>\") (lambda () (interactive) (my-cc-mode-M-RET t)))\n```"}, "ggoehoo": {"author": "zackallison", "upvotes": 9, "body": "## u/zackallison [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ki09cm/comment/ggoehoo) \n**Votes:** 9\n\nI posted this in the emacsclient thread, but I think it deserves to live here as well:\n\n\nThe emacsclient / server system is great.  If you have it listening on tcp and port forward that when connecting to remote machine it adds another level of power.\n\nI use [emacs-vterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) for a terminal inside emacs, so I've got a lot of commands remapped.  Like `man` runs `emacsclient ... man ..`, which opens the man page in the \"other\" buffer, so it doesn't interrupt my flow.  I use \"scroll-other-window\" to navigate the man page while I still have my prompt. `magit`, `dired`, and others map to their `emacsclient` equivalents.\n\nI've written wrapper script for e/emacs client that I've come to call `e`, because it saves keystrokes\n\n#### [The full repo is here e-emacs.sh](https://gitlab.com/zackallison/e-emacs/)\n\nIt does the standard things you would expect, starts emacs if it's not already started, open a file in a new buffer / window / terminal and optionally wait for you to finish or have the shell continue.\n\nThen I added some functions that I found useful, starting with piping results from a command into an emacs buffer, such as `find . -name foo\\* | e`.  Naturally after that was piping from a buffer to a command: `e [file] | rot13` super secure encryption.  And of course piping into and out of a buffer works as well `find . -name incriminating-evidence\\* | e | xargs rm`, so you can verify / tweak the results before passing them through.  Maybe you want to leave the evidence on Two Time Tommy.  Who knows.\n\nThe other nice feature is the ability to use templates.  For example to edit a HTTP request and then send it to a server you can do that: `e -t header_template.txt | nc www.example.com 80`  The template file is copied to a temp file which is the one that is edited.\n\nOr the poor man's blog system: `e -t header_template.html body_template.html footer.html > new_page.html`\n\nSee the repo for more examples and to download.  The notes of getting it working on remote machines aren't the cleanest.  If you have any suggestions or features that would make your life easier let me know; submit an issue or comment here.\n\n#### [The full repo is here e-emacs.sh](https://gitlab.com/zackallison/e-emacs/)\n\n~~I really should post this on one of the share your stuff posts.

Chances are, the term you're trying to complete is in the buffer you're using or another buffer, and you can hit multiple times to cycle through different completions. I find the expander to be quicker and more deterministic than language autocomplete about 70% of the time.

If it isn't, the command operates on the text from point to the end of the buffer.  That's very reasonable and in line with various other commands, but the documentation doesn't mention it and so I never thought to try it.\n\nThat saves me a call to `C-x h` (`mark-whole-buffer`) whenever I want to process the entire buffer, which is most of the time.  Also, it's a minor distraction for the entire buffer to be highlighted when I'm composing my shell command, so it's nice to avoid that.\n\nEdited to add:  Sorry folks, this doesn't work like I thought it did.

Use it's keymap for your keybindings, without the prefix.  Then assign that keymap to a prefix. This way, you can disable most of your keybindings easily when needed, you can easily switch your prefix key (e.g. go from `C-c` to `H-x` or `<menu>`, etc.), have those keybindings available on multiple prefixes, and you can easily restore a default keybinding via `(define-key my-minor-mode-map <key> nil)`.  Here is how I define a minor mode for myself:\n\n```elisp\n;;; The GK minor mode:\n    \n;; The GK minor mode is at the heart of this configuration.

But it has other a few other features that are useful:\n\n- You don't have to be between words to use it: if you are on a word, from the second character on, it will swap that word with the next.\n\n- If you are at the end of the buffer and use it you get an error message, \"Don\u2019t have two things to transpose\", _but_ you additionally get placed at the beginning of the last word in the buffer. So `M-t M-t` used at the end of the buffer will swap the last two words!\n\n- You can use it to swap _non-adjacent_ words too! If you call it with a numeric argument of 0, it will swap the word at the start of the region with the next word after the end of the region. For example, say you want to swap \"two\" with \"five\" in the following line:\n\n```elisp\n  one five three four two six\n    \n```\n  You can mark the words \"five three four\" (but don't mark \"two\") and then `M-0 M-t` will swap \"five\", the first word in the region, with \"two\" the first word _after_ the region.\n\nThat last trick works with the other `transpose-` commands as well, not just words: `transpose-chars`, `transpose-lines`, `transpose-paragraphs`, `transpose-sentences`, and `transpose-sexps`. Of course, if that `C-0` trick can't be used with any of those commands to swap the two things you want, there is always `transpose-regions`."}, "fk567v4": {"author": "zkryrmr", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/zkryrmr [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fgahb2/comment/fk567v4) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nHere is how you can calculate how many times larger an objects shadow is at solar noon.

Then, you can associate Emacs with many filetypes with emacsclient, and view them in Emacs.  E.g., this is how I view PDF files. `-c` is useful because it opens in a new frame, thus your window setup is left intact and the OS window is always in the current workspace (useful if you've set up your WM to not focus urgent windows automatically).\n\nIn a similar vein, I use [this script](https://github.com/cadadr/configuration/blob/master/emacs.d/extras/mailto.el.in) to redirect `mailto:` links to Emacs so that I can write my mails in `message-mode` within Emacs. I've set it as the mail program in Firefox.  It's probably possible to write a `.desktop` file for this so that you can set it in `mimeapps.list` or whatever as the global mail composer, but IDK how to do that.\n\nWith emacsclient and a bit of Elisp, it's really easy to integrate Emacs to a FreeDesktop environment.

I work in a big monorepo and depend on `projectile` for navigation by adding `.projectile` files here and there, in subdirectories that I consider \"projects\". However there are some directories that e.g. contain libraries. If I want to work on all of them for e.g. refactoring, going into a project then locks me in that (I mean `projectile-find-file`) and I have to manually go into another project. Also I flood my projectile cache with little things that I might not use a lot.

So some things you might find interesting:\n\n#### [Registers](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Registers.html)\n\nSomeone posted this in a weekly tips/trick/etc thread a few weeks ago, but I thought I'd mention it again.\n\nRegisters just let you store *things* in them. This can be\n\n- Cursor positions in buffers (`C-x r SPC [name you want to give the register]`)\n- Text in a region (`C-x r s [name you want to give the register]`)\n- Rectangles (`C-x r r [name you want to give the register]`)\n- State of windows in frames (`C-x r w [name you want to give the register]`)\n- State of all frames and their windows (`C-x r f [name you want to give the register]`)\n- Numbers (`C-x r n [name you want to give the register]`) and you can increment those numbers (`C-x r + [name of register you want to increment`]\n- Whole file names (it's not bound, but you can do `M-: (set-register ?z '(file . \"/some_file/somewhere/some_text.txt\"))`)\n- Keyboard macros instead of saving them (` C-x C-k x  [name you want to give the register]`)\n\nYou can insert text, registers, or numbers with `C-x r i [name of register with stuff to insert]`. You can also append or prepend stuff to registers with `append-to-register` or `prepend-to-register`.\n\n`C-x r j [name of register]` can jump to a point, restore a window or frame configuration, or visit a file with a specific name.\n\nYou could always use [bookmarks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html#Bookmarks).\n\nOne thing I would like to do is automatically give registers names, say like a1, a2, et cetera then b1, b2 et cetera, and then A1, A2 and yaddah yaddah.\n\nI'm an idiot though and generating that sort of collection escapes me a bit.\n\nI'd rather not do just\n\n```elisp\n(loop n from 0 to 99\n    collect (concat \"a\" n))\n\n```\nfor every alphabetical character. Then it'd be a matter of going through those collections for every register created and making sure they use different names. Was wondering if I could get some help.\n\n#### [Isearch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch) and [Query Replace](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Query-Replace.html)\n\nNot much to say here, just that I might recommend that one go over the default keys for [isearch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch#toc2) and query-replace.\n\nAlso I would switch `C-s` and `C-r` to use `isearch-forward-regex` and `isearch-backward-regex`, and `M-%` to use `query-replace-regex` because you can disable the use of regex for both. You can even start a query-replace from isearch with `M-%` or `C-M-%`.\n\n#### `event-apply-*` Keys\n\nI don't really know what I can use these keys for, but with which-key you can press `C-x @` to see them. They allow you to apply control, shift, alt, meta, super, or hyper keys."}, "kywimnf": {"author": "geza42", "upvotes": 22, "body": "## u/geza42 [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1c0gg7n/comment/kywimnf) \n**Votes:** 22\n\nYasnippet has the capability of surrounding.

Anyhow, for anyone working with code projects, I'm finding that project.el is completely supplanting my previously heavy use of Treemacs.  I liked Treemacs because it's a very similar feel to the file/project sidebar in Sublime Text and VSCode (and others I'm sure).  It was kind of reassuring.  And dired is nice for many things, but navigating a lot of directories does get a little tedious compared to just opening nested directories in Treemacs. \n\nWell, I don't even remember why I started tinkering with project.el.  I think I read a post where someone described switching projects, so I set it up, figured couldn't hurt.  Man, definitely a good idea.  The \"project goto file\" (`C-x p f`) is insanely convenient.  I also have ctags support setup so a quick keybind will let me switch files based on definition, and between the two, I get through files across the project seamlessly.  The project find directory is a faster way to direct dired to a place where I do want to see where things are stored.\n\nI suspect completion is doing a lot of heavy lifting here though too, so a perfectly pristine project.el use might have a different experience, but those are quite common anymore.\n\nAnyway, I haven't popped open the Treemacs sidebar in weeks now, and just felt like I should write something in case someone was curious about how handy it was."}, "jhtis87": {"author": "swhalemwo", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/swhalemwo [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zaqju/comment/jhtis87) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nrecently started writing a report with a lot of numbers, many of which will change in later versions.

I just figured out something pretty easy: just use a nonexistent link type.\n\nI don't care about the follow behavior, or export -- just showing the tooltip under the house, or in the help-echo area, so if I do something like\n\n```elisp\n[[abbrev:this stands for Some Random Acronym][SRA]]\n\n```\nthe buffer shows \"SRA\" as an org link, and when point or the mouse is over it, I get the expected message. There's nothing special about \"abbrev\", except that it hasn't been defined as an org link type. If I try to follow the link, org tries to create a heading, but for such things, I'm not going to follow the link, or export it, so that behavior doesn't matter.\n\nAnother use is for footnote-style things: say, in a table you want a cell where you can add some kind of note or comment, but don't want the cell to be very big. You can make your table like this:\n\n\n```elisp\n| col A | notes |\n|-------+-------|\n|  1234 | [[whatever:this is a note or comment about this row in the table][note]]  |\n|       |       |\n\n```\nand the cell just says \"note\", but I can see the rest when I hover.\n\nTo get the link target -- the note, the abbreviation, and so on -- to display in the help-echo area, you'll need to set `help-at-pt-display-when-idle` suitably: see https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/54319/how-to-display-target-of-an-org-mode-link-in-the-echo-area-or-as-tooltip."}, "j67y1pt": {"author": "snippins1987", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/snippins1987 [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/10ktqj0/comment/j67y1pt) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nContext: after finally getting into org-mode (org-roam specifically) and writing a bunch of elisp, I still dot not at all satisfy dealing with *org-table* or *table.el*, it just felt so out-of-place and clunky compare to the otherwise slick experiences that org-mode bring. So I basically gave up and have been linking spreadsheet files into my org files instead.\n\nObviously, this isn't ideal, as I need to view tables in separated libreoffice calc windows. And the notes is not viewable on GitLab or GitHub, etc.\n\nSo I decided to leverage org-babel to render spreadsheets inside my org notes.\n\nFor that, I created a bash script called emacs_excel_to_png that utilize ssconvert, ImageMagick, and Firefox. The script converts the spreadsheet into HTML, then the HTML is rendered by Firefox and finally ImageMagick will be used to crop the rendered image. The script will then print an org-link so that the image is showed the result section.\n\nWith that, in an org file, we can do something as follows:\n\n```elisp\n#+begin_src bash :dir ./ :results raw :var ZOOM=1.3\nexport ZOOM; emacs_excel_to_png \\\n    \"note_files/emacs_excel_to_png.xlsx\" \\\n    \"note_files/emacs_excel_to_png.png\"\n#+end_src\n\n```\nThe content of the emacs_excel_to_png script can be found below:\n\n```elisp\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n    \nexcel_file=\"$1\"\noutput_file=\"$2\"\n    \nif [[ \"$#\" -lt 2 ]]; then\n    notify-send \"Not enough parameters\"\n    exit\nfi\n    \ntmp_dir=\"/dev/shm\"\nmkdir -p $tmp_dir/emacs_excel_to_png\n    \nif !

It even works over SSH. No changes needed to `init.el`.\n\nThe trick is that Emacs has built-in keybindings like `C-x @ s` that simulates a super modifier and `C-x @ h` that simulates a hyper modifier. So if you press e.g. `C-x @ s a`, then Emacs will interpret that as super+a.\n\nTerminals like e.g. Kitty lets you bind super+a to do whatever you want, so you can simply map it to send the key sequences that Emacs expects. Just add this to e.g. `kitty.conf`:\n\n```elisp\nmap super+a send_key ctrl+x @ s a\nmap super+b send_key ctrl+x @ s b\n...\n```\nAnd voila, super works fine in `emacs -nw`! Kitty translates `s-a` into normal terminal-supported control keybindings `C-x @ s a`, which Emacs then translates back into `s-a`."}, "iatuubw": {"author": "PriorOutcome", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/PriorOutcome [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/v2by7z/comment/iatuubw) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nI like being able to switch projects quickly, and I'm too lazy to choose a specific file after selecting which project to switch to, so I did this:\n\n```elisp\n(defun lw-switch-project ()\n(interactive)\n(let* ((projects (projectile-relevant-known-projects))\n       (project (f-expand (completing-read \"Switch to project: \" projects)))\n       (windows (window-list))\n       (opened-files (projectile-project-buffers project))\n       (all-files (if (> (length windows) (length opened-files))\n                      (append\n                       opened-files\n                       (--> (projectile-project-files project)\n                         (-take (- (length windows)(length opened-files)) it)\n                         (-map (-partial #'f-join project) it)\n                         (-map #'find-file-noselect it)))\n                    opened-files)))\n  (--each (-zip windows all-files)\n    (set-window-buffer (car it) (cdr it)))))\n\n```\nA little verbose, but basically it prompts for a projectile project, then fills all open windows with recent project files, preferring already open buffers."}, "i9x2a0i": {"author": "khourhin", "upvotes": 8, "body": "## u/khourhin [\ud83d\udd17](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/uxcm6i/comment/i9x2a0i) \n**Votes:** 8\n\nJust discovered that you can do pull request from magit forge.

It turns out the default \"template\" for the `entry` capture type is `\"* %?\\n%a\"`, where the code `%a` means \"annotation,\" ie, a link to the file location.

It is available from AUCTeX via the `TeX-documentation-texdoc` command, which I find useful. However, it requires typing out the package name by hand (though it uses symbol-at-point as the default). Recently I found that the texdoc wiki contains a snippet how to add [tab-completion](https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/wiki/Tab-completion), which showed me where to get a list of installed TeXLive package names.
