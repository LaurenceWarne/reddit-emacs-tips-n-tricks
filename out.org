Do you think it might be good to make this a little less frequently refreshed? There are usually some great tips that get lost to Reddit’s ephemerality pretty quickly.

I think monthly would be better, given the modest size of this subreddit.

Nothing revolutionary (and veterans will already know this), but a nice little function for splitting out text to a separate file:

1. Select the text (visual mode with Evil, or however you do it)
2. ~M-x write-region~ and give it a file name to write out your selection to the named file. Nice and quick.

It's in the manual, and a basic little feature, but really handy. https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Misc-File-Ops.html

I guess the other tip is to read the manual. :)

After years of using emacs, I wrote my second ever elisp function to open on github the code I'm browsing in emacs.

back-to-indentation. Before I found this function I would always do some awkward triple key combo like C-a M-f M-b.

It's just bound to M-m. Jumps you right to the first non-white space character on the line. What's even spicier is that it works in reverse too - if you're at the front of the line it jumps you forward, if you're at the end or middle it jumps backward.

It still works even on lines that aren't indented, same as C-a in that case.

So useful, especially for resetting point during macros that need to start at the first char on the line.

Yasnippet has the capability of surrounding. For example, if you have this C++ namespace snippet:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: namespace-surround
# key: ns
# --
namespace ${1}${1:$(if (> (length yas-text) 0) " {" "{")}
~yas-selected-text~$0
} // namespace${1:$(if (> (length yas-text) 0) (concat " " (substring-no-properties yas-text)) "")}

#+END_SRC
Then if you bind ~(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "namespace-surround"))~ to some key, then you can select some code, press your keybinding, and the selected code will be surrounded by "namespace NAME {" and "} // namespace NAME".

~shortdoc~ - one of the new things in Emacs 28.1 - is great for maintaining your own "cheat sheets" of Elisp functions as you discover them. For example, eval this in your Emacs session:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(define-short-documentation-group my-datetime
  "Querying current time"
  (current-time
   :eval (current-time))
  (float-time
   :eval (float-time))
  
  "Time formats"
  (time-convert
   :eval (time-convert (current-time))
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'list)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 100000)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 200000)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) t)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'integer))
  
  (float-time
   :eval (float-time (current-time))))

#+END_SRC
After this, the ~my-datetime~ group will show as an option in ~M-x shortdoc-display-group~. Additionally, if you view help for any of the functions mentioned above, the Help buffer will refer back to the ~my-datetime~ shortdoc group!

The example used here is a cheatsheet I just started writing for myself, as I've been researching the built-in time functions. For additional instructions on use, see ~define-short-documentation-group~ macro. For use examples, jump to the source of ~define-short-documentation-group~ and scroll down a bit - the default shortdoc groups are defined there.

Just figured this out, maybe a bit of a hack...

In flyspell, I was annoyed I had to use mouse-2 when I wanted to correct a word, and I didn't want to sacrifice a major-mode keybinding to do it from the keyboard. But flyspell actually creates an overlay for misspelled words and attaches a keymap to it, which you can do I just realized- very cool. So I just bound ~flyspell-correct-at-point~ to "<return>" in the ~flyspell-mouse-map~, and now return corrects words when my cursor is on a misspelled word!

But the fact you can attach keymaps to overlays just seems so useful, will definitely use in the future.

A dump of my Emacs-related principles after 18 years of tinkering:

1. Don't try to replicate a static IDE setup, Emacs is fluid. 
2. Emacs Lisp is inevitable for Emacser to make this fluidity possible.
3. Language-agnostic is better than language-specific. 
4. Embrace display-alist, fast window manipulation, winner-mode. 
5. .emacs.el reset every couple of years to accomodate innovation. 
6. Org-mode/org-roam for all documentation, projects, tips. The agenda is not set in stone. Use queries, filters, tweak, evolve things. 
7. A contextual dwim is always better than many keybindings. 
8. Use completion everywhere on everything (vertico is magic).  
9. Contribute to the core and favourite packages.

I am a beginner though, things might change.

I'm a big user of ~ffap~. I use this function with ~M-x~ each time I want to open a file whose name is under the cursor.

But this week I discovered ~ffap-bindings~. This function replaces some key bindings to use ~ffap~ when it makes sense. For example, it replaces ~find-file~ with ~find-file-at-point~, so the usual keybindings are enriched at no cost.

~use-package~ has an inbuilt feature that roughly reports the loading times of each package on startup ([[https://github.com/jschaf/esup][~esup~]] most likely does a better job, if you can get it to run; there are  [[https://github.com/alexmurray/emacs-snap/issues/71][known issues]] on Emacs snap):

I recently discovered ~thing-at-point-looking-at~, which seems much easier to use on its own than to fully define a new kind of "thing."

For a while I've been wanting to conveniently identify a Jira ticket identifier at point so I can browse to it.  Ticket IDs are basically a sequence of letters, a hyphen, and a sequence of digits.  First I tried using ~symbol-at-point~, but that can include extraneous neighboring characters, like ~/~ when the ticket ID is part of a URL.  Eventually, while poring over the ~thingatpt~ source, I found ~thing-at-point-looking-at~, which quickly led to:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun browse-ticket-at-point ()

I have two org mode link tips:

1. ~(setq org-return-follows-link t)~ lets you press RET to follow a
   link. Don't worry, the traditional behavior of RET, namely inserting
   a newline, is still easy: ~C-q C-j~.

2. I often want to see what the destination of a link is. I used to
   use one of these methods:
   
   - mouse hover,
   - running and canceling ~org-insert-link~ (~C-c C-l~, read the
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 destination, ~C-g~),
#+END_SRC
   - ~org-toggle-link-display~, which toggles between the neat formatting of 
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 links and the raw source and is pretty ugly.
 
#+END_SRC
   But a better option is to use ~display-local-help~ (~C-h .~), which
   will show the tooltip in the echo area. And, you can even have the
   tooltip at point echoed automatically with ~(setq
   help-at-pt-display-when-idle t)~. There is a delay controlled by
   the variable ~help-at-pt-timer-delay~ which I like to set to 0.
   Beware that just using ~(setq help-at-pt-timer-delay 0)~ has no effect,
   you need to use ~customize-set-variable~ or manually cancel the
   timer and set a new one (see below).
   
   Now, these ~help-at-pt~ variables aren't specifically for org
   links, they control the behavior of all tooltips, and I quickly
   realized I really only wanted to change the behavior in org mode
   buffers. You can do that as follows:
   
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (defun echo-area-tooltips ()
     "Show tooltips in the echo area automatically for current buffer."
     (setq-local help-at-pt-display-when-idle t
                 help-at-pt-timer-delay 0)
     (help-at-pt-cancel-timer)
     (help-at-pt-set-timer))

If you're like me, and your day ends way past midnight, handling those last few tasks in your Org Mode agenda gets tricky. Fortunately, it turns out Org Mode has what I call "25th hour mode".

(setq org-extend-today-until 3) 
    
;; make timestamp processing functions aware of this

Combined, this allows to extend the day past midnight, with things like agenda views, scheduling commands, repeaters, etc. thinking the current time is 23:59 up until the ~org-extend-today-until~ limit. With this enabled, if I have a task that has a repeater of  and complete it at 01:00, I no longer have to then manually reschedule the task back one day.

A very simple thing I've done is remap ";" (semicolon) to to "\_" (underscore) in almost all modes. Since I work with mainly Python, this is so much easier than always doing SHIFT-DASH every couple of keystrokes. And if I want a regular semicolon, I just do "C-u ;" and insert a semicolon

I also set this in modes such as C/C++, etc. This works by automatically setting the last character (if it was an underscore) to a semicolon on enter. 

eg. "|" is cursor

int a = 10\*10\_|

turns into

int a = 10\*10;

| (cursor on new line)

&#x200B;

It is amazing with the ~orderless~ dispatchers to control the search filtering.
I use ~!~ to exclude a string and ~=~ to match exactly.

Also amazing with ~embark-collect~ which allows collapsing features.
Or within the collect buffer use ~consult-line~ to further filter.

If you want to search and replace but with preview for the matches, don't use ~query-replace-regexp~ directly. Instead start by searching for your regexp in ~isearch-forward-regexp~, which highlights the matches interactively, and once you have the correct regexp, run ~isearch-query-replace~ (bound to ~M-%~ in ~isearch-mode-map~).

Note that there is also an ~isearch-query-replace-regexp~ command but you don't need it: ~isearch-query-replace~ will automatically detect if your isearch session was for regexps. The docstring for ~isearch-query-replace~ doesn't seem to mention this nice feature.

If you need to find all the occurrences of a string in the project files, but only **on some specific type of files**, you can use ~consult-ripgrep~ with ~-- -t~ in the search pattern.

For example, If you need occurrences of ~fancystr~ in files of type ~html~, the search pattern should be ~fancystr -- -t html~

From ~consult-grep~ documentation, command line options can be passed to grep, specified behind ~--.~  The overall prompt input has the form:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
#async-input -- rg-opts#filter-string

#+END_SRC
I have just discovered this, and it made my day.

Plain old ~query-replace~ has many cool features, first of all it respects the active region (if it's active it will only query for replacements in the active region).  There are many useful keys in addition to plain ~y~/~n~:

~!~: replaces all remaning matches

~u~: undo last replacement

~E~: changes replacement string on the fly

And many more you can see using ~?~.

In preparation for the inclusion of eglot into Emacs core I've switched away from lsp-mode. As a result I've also switched from flycheck and to flymake. One nice thing about flycheck is that it allowed for stacking checkers. When coding Python I liked to stack flake8 for styles and mypy for types (plus the LSP's since it's already there).

Flymake allows for stacking checkers but it turns out eglot clobbers these checkers when "adding" the LSP's checker. To get stacked Flymake checkers with Eglot you can simply add them back after Eglot has done it's thing.

For example, here is a simple setup for Python which includes Pyright's type checking and flake8 style checking

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Use flake8 as the python style checker by default
(setq python-flymake-command '("flake8" "-"))
    
(use-package eglot
  :hook ((python-mode . eglot-ensure)
         (eglot-managed-mode
	  . (lambda ()
	      ;; re-enable flymake checkers because eglot clobbers
	      ;; them when starting
	      (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode)
		(add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions 
                          'python-flymake nil t)))))
    
  :custom
  ;; shutdown server after killing last managed buffer
  (eglot-autoshutdown t)
  :bind
  (("C-c l r" . eglot-rename))
  :config
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               ~(python-mode "pyright-langserver" "-w" "--stdio")))

#+END_SRC
Now all that's left is mypy. Flymake originally used a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/flymake.html#The-legacy-Proc-backend]["Proc"]] method for creating checkers which existing mypy ones use. So for a bonus tip & trick [[http://github.com/com4/flymake-mypy][I've written a mypy checker in the new style]]. It can be enabled when using eglot like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package flymake-mypy
  :straight (flymake-mypy
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "com4/flymake-mypy")
  :hook ((eglot-managed-mode . (lambda ()
				 (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode)
				   (flymake-mypy-enable))))))

#+END_SRC
After opening a Python buffer and executing ~M-x flymake-running-backends~ we are greeted with a list of stacked checkers: ~Running backends: eglot-flymake-backend, flymake-mypy--run, python-flymake~.

I don’t have any specific tip but I just want to throw it out there that if you are tired of using spacemacs or doom it was much easier to set up my own install than I thought. It only took me a couple of days of active work and now diagnosing problems is so much simpler. Not to say that you should not use either one but I wanted to learn more about emacs and I’ve been really happy with the results.

Working on a remote server with Tramp in eshell it's so easy that I'm always worried that I could run by mistake a command on the wrong machine.

So I implemented a small function that makes me aware that I'm in a Tramp session by changing the prompt color.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'subr-x)  
(defun tuxo/prompt-color-tramp ()  
"Change prompt color if a tramp session is open"  
  (if (file-remote-p default-directory)  
      (set-face-foreground 'eshell-prompt "red")  
      (set-face-foreground 'eshell-prompt "green")))
    
(use-package eshell
  :hook (eshell-post-command . tuxo/prompt-color-tramp))

#+END_SRC
Do you have any suggestions on how I could improve this issue?

I'm slowly working on an alternative shell: [[https://github.com/TatriX/tshell][https://github.com/TatriX/tshell]]

Instead of using repl-like interface, all the commands go to one buffer (and file if you want) and output goes to another buffer. Like if you put your elisp code in \*scratch\* buffer and then evaluate it with \~C-x C-e\~.

It's in a very early stage, but it already allows me to solve most tasks I usually do with more traditional shells.

Let me know what is your first impression, what can be improved and what  do you think in general!

I just discovered the [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/selected.el][selected]] package, which is brilliant. It creates a keymap that becomes active any time you have an active region. I have bindings for next-line, previous-line, rectangle-mark-mode, end-of-line, upcase-dwim, exchange-point-and-mark, etc. It makes editing and acting on the active region super easy. Sort of like god-mode or Vim's visual mode.

For ~use-package~ users (which I assume is many of us), did you know that profiling is easy to do? I'm not talking about ~esup~, but a built-in capability that makes it very straightforward to find places to optimize your ~init.el~ for significantly faster start times.

Enable ~use-package-compute-statistics~ right after you load ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq use-package-compute-statistics t)

#+END_SRC
Restart emacs, and then invoke ~use-package-report~. You'll get a table of the load times for each package that ~use-package~ manages. I discovered this and found an immediate way to cut my startup time in half by fixing a few packages that weren't deferred properly by adding the right ~:hook~ keyword.

You can toggle vertico's height between 15 and "almost full frame" with this. When vertico is invoked, it will always have a height of 15. But if you have a lot of matches, and like to have a better overview, press the binding, and vertico will show a full frame of matches. This is useful for example when ~consult-buffer~ presents a lot of buffers.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(advice-add 'vertico--setup :before (lambda () (setq vertico-count 15)))
(define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd "s-'") (lambda ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((vertico-resize t))
    (setq vertico-count (if (= vertico-count 15) (- (frame-height) 5) 15))
    (vertico--exhibit))))

#+END_SRC
Another useful feature is to kill buffers in ~consult-buffer~ without manually invoking ~embark-act~. I miss this feature from Helm, where you can do actions using only one binding (no need to press an intermediate binding which invokes ~embark-act~). Note, I just blindly copied some of the logic from ~embark~, maybe there are some unnecessary things here.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-embark-M-k (&optional arg)
  (interactive "P")
  (require 'embark)
  (if-let ((targets (embark--targets)))
      (let* ((target
              (or (nth
                  (if (or (null arg) (minibufferp))
                      0
                    (mod (prefix-numeric-value arg) (length targets)))
                  targets)))
            (type (plist-get target :type)))
        (cond
         ((eq type 'buffer)
          (let ((embark-pre-action-hooks))
            (embark--act 'kill-buffer target)))))))

(define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd "M-k") 'my-embark-M-k)

I'm not sure whether these two can be achieved out-of-the box, but I didn't find these functionalities, so I created them.

I've been using ~mu4e~ for some years now, and I really love it. However, I'm also a Gmail user, don't love it, but consider myself stuck with it (given budget constraints and it being my email for several years already). This makes me always weary of "the next Google shenanigan" which might break my workflow. One of the things I have learned to cherish about using ~mu4e~ is its integration with Org, with it's ~org-capture~ support, which enables me not to confuse my Inbox with my todo list, thus keeping my Inbox clean. So I came up with a preventive function, leveraging ~org-protocol~ to be able to capture a Gmail message from a bookmarklet on the browser.  Not particularly pretty code, but functional.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Add org-protocol to capture email in Gmail.
  (add-to-list 'org-protocol-protocol-alist
               '("org-gmail-capture" :protocol "gmail-capture"
                 :function gb/org-protocol-gmail-capture))

  ;; Bookmarklet:
  ;;   javascript:location.href = 'org-protocol://gmail-capture?' +
  ;;       new URLSearchParams({
  ;;           msg: document.getElementById("raw_message_text").innerHTML});
  ;; Must be called from the "Original message" page.
  (defun gb/org-protocol-gmail-capture (info)
    "Process an org-protocol://gmail-capture style url with INFO.

This function detects the raw message text element from the \"Original
message\" page of a Gmail message.  It then parses relevant message
fields and calls the \"email\" org-capture template.

The location for a browser's bookmark looks like this:

  javascript:location.href = \\='org-protocol://gmail-capture?\\=' +
      new URLSearchParams({
          msg: document.getElementById(\"raw_message_text\").innerHTML});

This must be called from the "Original message" page (which you can get with the "Show original" menu item). It won't work elsewhere.

The link created is a ~gmail:~ type link which essentially just copies ~rfc822msgid:<messageID>~ to the kill-ring/clipboard, which you can paste in Gmail's search bar to go to the message of interest.

You can use EWW to bypass pay-walls on news sites, and other Javascript-enabled nastiness. Plus, eww can copy from what it sees into equivalent orgmode syntax, and it's also compatible with SPRAY for speed-reading. In otherwords, EWW is great for when you just need to READ the internet.

I use Emacs for React development and it's usually great (rjsx-mode). We recently introduced styled components into our app and while they're very handy, not having proper css support inside rjsx-mode was pretty annoying. I was looking for solutions, maybe extending rjsx-mode, but I wasn't up to that task. I then realized the built-in emacs commands and buffers themselves could solve my problem! What I want is for css inside a styled component, which always looks something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
const myDiv = styled.div~ // notice the backtick
    Some css...
 ~ // ending backtick

#+END_SRC
to *actually* use scss-mode when editing, and then return to rjsx-mode when finished. The elisp is very simple and leads to a trivial workflow:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; The following 2 functions allow editing styled components with all scss mode features.
(defun edit-styled-component ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    (save-excursion
      (let ((start (search-backward "~"))
            (end (search-forward "~" nil nil 2))) ; second occurrence, since first is ~start'
        (narrow-to-region start end)))
    (scss-mode)))

(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'rjsx-mode
  "ms" 'edit-styled-component)

;; When editing is done, use the same key sequence to return to the original file.
(defun return-from-styled-component ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    (widen)
    (rjsx-mode)))

So now when I edit a styled component I just hit **, m s**, which narrows the region to whatever is enclosed by backticks (i.e. all the css) and actually treats it as a bona fide css buffer, with all my snippets, completion, etc. Then when I'm done I just got **, m s** again to widen back to the original (rjsx) buffer!

## Use chrome DOM for eww

Basically, a lot of websites these days generate the DOM using javascript. You can dump the DOM from chrome and inject it into eww just before it renders.

It's set to wait 3 seconds before dumping the DOM. This allows many pages to load.

Since I'm using the ~unbuffer~ program, this requires ~expect~ to be installed on your system. It creates a tty so that chrome doesn't crash when run in this way.

~dump-dom~ shell script

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
#!/bin/bash
    
url="$1"
test -n "$url" || exit 1
    
0</dev/tty unbuffer bash -c "chrome --headless --disable-gpu --virtual-time-budget=3000 --dump-dom \"$url\" 2>/dev/null"

Any **BibTeX** users here?

- Tired of journals forcing you to download a file to get the BibTeX record of an article?
- Tired of their usually broken formatting?
- The journal doesn't offer BibTeX download in the first place? (Looking at you Nature)

Did you know that doi.org has query interface that gives you the BibTeX record when you call it with the article DOI?  Of course you can access this via Emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'url)
(defun user/url-bibtex-from-doi (doi)
  (interactive "sDOI: ")
  (let* ((url (concat "https://doi.org/" doi))
         (url-mime-accept-string "application/x-bibtex"))
    (insert
     (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously url)
       (let* ((start url-http-end-of-headers)
              (end (point-max))
              (all (buffer-string))
              (body (buffer-substring start end)))
         (replace-regexp-in-string "^\t" "  " (url-unhex-string body)))))))

#+END_SRC
Just paste the DOI of the article at the prompt and the BibTeX record will be inserted at point.

Here is how I bind it in ~bibtex-mode~ (plus my other bindings for good measure)
    
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; bibtex
(use-package bibtex
  :bind (:map bibtex-mode-map
              ("C-c d" . user/url-bibtex-from-doi)
              ("C-c v" . bibtex-validate)
              ("C-c s" . bibtex-sort-buffer)
              ([down-mouse-3] . imenu))

I regularly work with different emacs frames on different monitors, and [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/framemove][~framemove~]] is great for switching between them.  It can hook into ~windmove~ (which means switching to an adjacent window becomes switching to an adjacent frame if no such window exists) and offers the functions:

\* ~fm-up-frame~: move to the frame over the current frame
\* ~fm-down-frame~: move to the frame below the current frame
\* ~fm-left-frame~: move to the frame left of the current frame
\* ~fm-right-frame~: move to the frame right of the current frame

It's not on any of the major package repositories, so you have to install it manually.  Thanks to [[https://github.com/emacsmirror][~emacsmirror~]], this can for example be done as follows using ~use-package~ and ~straight~ (adjust bindings to your liking):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package framemove
    :straight (:host github :repo "emacsmirror/framemove")
    :init
    (setq framemove-hook-into-windmove t) ;; doesn't work as :config or :custom
    :bind
    (("C-x 5 <up>" . fm-up-frame)
     ("C-x 5 <down>" . fm-down-frame)
     ("C-x 5 <left>" . fm-left-frame)
     ("C-x 5 <right>" . fm-right-frame)))

#+END_SRC
edit: The only thing I don't understand is why setting ~framemove-hook-into-windmove~ to ~t~ doesn't work in via ~:config~ or ~:custom~.  The package is loaded, ~C-h f~ confirms that ~fm-up-frame~ exists, but ~C-h v~ doesn't know ~framemove-hook-into-windmove~. ~framemove-hook-into-windmove~ exists after I run ~fm-up-frame~, but then it's set to ~nil~ and not ~t~.

I thought about making a whole post about this, but it's mostly ancillary appreciation so maybe this is a better place.  Anyhow, for anyone working with code projects, I'm finding that project.el is completely supplanting my previously heavy use of Treemacs.  I liked Treemacs because it's a very similar feel to the file/project sidebar in Sublime Text and VSCode (and others I'm sure).  It was kind of reassuring.  And dired is nice for many things, but navigating a lot of directories does get a little tedious compared to just opening nested directories in Treemacs. 

Well, I don't even remember why I started tinkering with project.el.  I think I read a post where someone described switching projects, so I set it up, figured couldn't hurt.  Man, definitely a good idea.  The "project goto file" (~C-x p f~) is insanely convenient.  I also have ctags support setup so a quick keybind will let me switch files based on definition, and between the two, I get through files across the project seamlessly.  The project find directory is a faster way to direct dired to a place where I do want to see where things are stored.

I suspect completion is doing a lot of heavy lifting here though too, so a perfectly pristine project.el use might have a different experience, but those are quite common anymore.

Anyway, I haven't popped open the Treemacs sidebar in weeks now, and just felt like I should write something in case someone was curious about how handy it was.

If you use an LSP server with semantic highlighting, it's worth checking out the value of ~font-lock-maximum-decoration~. For example, I use ~c++-mode~ with ~lsp-mode~ (with clangd), I decreased ~font-lock-maximum-decoration~ to ~2~, and I didn't notice any highlighting difference (because the lost highlighting by ~c++-mode~ gets highlighted by ~lsp-mode~), while ~c++-mode~ font-locking become faster (~c++-mode~ 's font-locking works well 99.9% of the time, but sometimes it can become slow in some circumstances, these slowdowns seems to be gone).

I use:~(setq font-lock-maximum-decoration '((c-mode . 2) (c++-mode . 2) (t . t)))~

I recently discovered ~(setq read-minibuffer-restore-windows nil)~ which resolves my frustration that quitting the minibuffer would discard any changes to the window layout while the minibuffer was open. For example, by default, ~M-x C-h k k C-g~ quits the just opened help buffer. I'm sure to have missed many more QOL improvements from NEWS.

I jump into the built-in Elisp files a lot to see how things work. The indentation there is GNU standard, which uses a mix of tabs and spaces for alignment. The tabs have to be rendered as 8 spaces wide for the alignment to work, and I don't actually want that setting anywhere else. Since the files on Mac are inside the application bundle, I don't want to just add a .dir-locals.el file next to them, either.

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html][Directory classes]] to the rescue! My config makes a new directory variable class, ~builtin-elisp~, with a list saying that ~emacs-lisp-mode~ should use a ~tab-width~ of 8. Then it applies that class to the Elisp files in the application bundle:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package elisp-mode
  :config
  (dir-locals-set-class-variables
   'builtin-elisp
   '((emacs-lisp-mode . ((tab-width . 8)))))
  (dir-locals-set-directory-class
   (file-name-directory (directory-file-name (invocation-directory)))
   'builtin-elisp))

#+END_SRC
And now when I visit one of those files, the alignment is always correct.

Working in education, I often find myself having to assign students into groups. This week I made a function in ELisp that helps me do this.

I used to use the which-key package to discover key bindings, but now have completely dropped it ever since learning about ~C-h~. Say you want to use rectangle commands and remember they start with ~C-x r~, but can't remember anything after. Just enter ~C-x r~, followed by ~C-h~. It will list all the keys under that prefix. Seems to work with any prefix key like ~M-s~, ~C-c~, etc.

A related thing is that you can explore the keys for a major/minor mode with ~C-h b~, ~describe-bindings~. It used to be pretty useless because it would list every single possible keybinding and accent character, but in newer emacs it's way easier to navigate thanks to folding headings.

I recently discovered the [[https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el][Dimmer]] package and can't believe I didn't try it until now.  It subtly dims  windows that aren't focused, just enough to draw your eyes to the window that *is* focused.  And of course, you can customize how much it dims and exclude certain buffers.

I love things that reduce cognitive load like this.  You don't realize how much time you spent looking for little clues like a solid cursor, until you don't have to anymore.

I started using org-capture when I started my current job several years ago.  I recorded my daily activities using this template:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("d" "Done" entry (file+olp+datetree "~/org/done.org"))))

#+END_SRC
A minor annoyance was that an unwanted link to whatever file location I happened to be in when I invoked org-capture was stored along with my log entry.  I made occasional desultory efforts over the years to remove it, but I just couldn't figure it out.  I recently made a more concerted effort and _finally_ was able to work it out after poring over the documentation for the ~org-capture-templates~ variable.  It turns out the default "template" for the ~entry~ capture type is ~"* %?\n%a"~, where the code ~%a~ means "annotation," ie, a link to the file location.  So I just had to change my definition to this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("d" "Done" entry (file+olp+datetree "~/org/done.org") "* %?")))

I've just started to use macros. They are amazing. Here are my tips. C-x -( to start recording. C-x-) to stop recording. F4 to run last recorded macro. Always start at the beginning of a line. Always move by words or lines. If you go forward two chars and the next line needs you to go forward three chars, the macro won't work. Always return to the beginning of the line. For added awesome move down to the next line, positioning yourself to use the macro again.

describe-\*. It is one of the most useful feature sets to access documentation for just about everything there is in Emacs. Not sure what key bindings are set for a given mode? M-x describe-mode or C-h m. Need to know what font is begin used for a certain piece of text? M-x describe-char. Need to know how a given command works? M-x describe-command or C-h x. Need to know the value of a given variable? M-x describe-variable or C-h v.

If you are new to Emacs you will get so many answers to your questions by getting to know all of the describe functions.

I have long had convenience bindings for ~org-emphasize~ like ~super-i~ for /italic/, that match system bindings.  But I always wanted these to *be smarter*, i.e. do something useful when there is no text selected.  Something like intelligently toggling emphasis depending on whether you were already in the right kind of emphasized text, or just emphasize the word at point if not.

Recently I discovered that ~C-h C-q~ (or ~M-x help-quick~) opens a small window showing \*Quick Help\* buffer with a nice overview of some basic keybindings. It seems that the content of this buffer is configurable via the variable ~help-quick-sections~.

I intend to use it as a cheatsheet, reminding me about rare keybindings I always forget; I believe it is easy to make it context-dependent, just by changing the value of ~help-quick-sections~.

Emacs has better long-lines support now??

I just noticed while looking at the latest additions in the NEWS:

>\*\* Emacs is now capable of editing files with arbitrarily long lines. The display of long lines has been optimized, and Emacs no longer chokes when a buffer on display contains long lines.  If you still experience slowdowns while editing files with long lines, this is either due to font locking, which you can turn off with M-x font-lock-mode or C-u C-x x f, or to the current major mode or one of the enabled minor modes, in which case you should open the the file with M-x find-file-literally instead of C-x C-f.  The variable 'long-line-threshold' controls whether and when these display optimizations are used.

That sounds like great news!  Does anyone know what went into it?

(edit to add: this was added some time this week.  I rebuild from master weekly, and check out the NEWS diff each time)

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defservlet* capture/:keys/:contents text/plain () (org-capture-string contents keys))

Now I can hit "localhost:8080/capture/t/test reminder" and it'll put a "* TODO test reminder" line into my todo.org. Neat!

AucTeX

When you compile your TeX file and there are errors, the message asks you to see error messages using

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 C-c ~

#+END_SRC
This leads to the last error which is sometimes incomprehensible and you are left to yourself to figure out what went wrong.

Instead of getting the last error, you can get an overview of all the errors by setting below variable to ~t~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 (setq TeX-error-overview-open-after-TeX-run t)

#+END_SRC
You can pop this up in a separate frame using:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq TeX-error-overview-setup 'separate-frame)

#+END_SRC
Related docs are [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Error-overview.html][here]].

This totally changes the way you can handle errors messages.

# 27.1 do GC if no frame has focus

I am porting my [[https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/dotfiles][config]] from 26.3 to 27.1, which had the tweak to do GC whenever a frame loses focus, originally from [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d][MatthewZMD's config]] I think:
#+BEGIN_SRC elispelisp
(add-hook 'focus-out-hook #'garbage-collect)
#+END_SRC
27.1 NEWS say more generic (and more correct) ~after-focus-change-function~ should be used instead. Which pointed out that I do not want to GC on just any frame going out of focus, if another frame is being focused instead. It might be a better idea to GC if no frames at all are focused. Somewhat surprisingly I was not able to find any public dotfiles repo implementing this to copy paste from, so I tried to write my own:
#+BEGIN_SRC elispelisp
(defun dotfiles--gc-on-last-frame-out-of-focus ()
  "GC if all frames are inactive."
  (if (seq-every-p #'null (mapcar #'frame-focus-state (frame-list)))
  (garbage-collect)))

(add-function :after after-focus-change-function

I've been using ~M-|~ (~shell-command-on-region~) frequently for years, and I only just stumbled on the fact that the region need not be active to use it.  If it isn't, the command operates on the text from point to the end of the buffer.  That's very reasonable and in line with various other commands, but the documentation doesn't mention it and so I never thought to try it.

That saves me a call to ~C-x h~ (~mark-whole-buffer~) whenever I want to process the entire buffer, which is most of the time.  Also, it's a minor distraction for the entire buffer to be highlighted when I'm composing my shell command, so it's nice to avoid that.

Edited to add:  Sorry folks, this doesn't work like I thought it did.  See the coments below for details.

Simple hack to add attributes to the ~<html>~ tag of an exported org file by escaping the quote of the language header.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
#+HTML_DOCTYPE: html5
#+LANGUAGE: en" data-theme="dark

#+END_SRC
This when exported to html using ~org-html-export-to-html~ will result in:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
<html lang="en" data-theme="dark">

#+END_SRC
Useful when you include some classless css libraries which require you to add attributes to directly to ~<html>~ tag.

Don't skip ~HTML_DOCTYPE~ else it will duplicate the attribute because one extra will be added due to ~xml:lang~

[[https://gist.github.com/lesliesrussell/46302d413fcf49e9717eeea57fdadcbf][transient map for movement]]

Defines a transient keymap for movement controls and sets up a global key binding to activate this transient map. This transient map, \~my-movement-transient-map\~, includes bindings for various movement commands like moving forward or backward by a word or character and moving to the next or previous line. The \~activate-my-movement-map\~ function is defined to activate this transient map, and it is globally bound to \~C-f\~.

&#x200B;

This setup allows you to press \~C-f\~ followed by one of the specified keys (\~f\~, \~b\~, \~c\~, \~l\~, \~n\~, \~p\~) to perform the corresponding movement operation. The \~set-transient-map\~ call with a second argument of \~t\~ ensures that the transient map stays active until one of its keys is pressed.

&#x200B;

This is a neat way to create a custom, modal-like interface for movement within Emacs, leveraging your Emacs Lisp skills to tailor your editing environment to your preferences. If you have any specific modifications or additional features you'd like to implement, feel free to ask!

I was converting some old ~.odt~ notes files to ~.org~ today, and one of the things I wanted to do was to add two spaces after end of sentence periods for proper sentence navigation.  So there I was figuring out a general enough regexp for the nth time and, of course, I regretted not having taken note of this the last time. So I decided to do some searching for a good regexp and write it down this time, since this was obviously shared by someone somewhere. And it turns out Emacs has us covered, and I never knew: ~repunctuate-sentences~. I have no idea if this is new or has always been there. It is new to me. It uses ~query-replace-regexp~, so it's the same experience. And also can be configured for exclusions with ~repunctuate-sentences-filter~. Neat!

Do you want a key binding to wrap the selection in some kind of delimiter? Here's a built-in solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defvar insert-pair-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map [t] #'insert-pair)
    map))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-w") insert-pair-map)

#+END_SRC
This setups up ~C-S-w~ to be a prefix map, ~insert-pair-map~. The only key binding in ~insert-pair-map~ is for ~[t]~, which means it is the default key binding and any key after the prefix will run the same command: ~insert-pair~. Now, ~insert-pair~ looks at which key was used to invoke it and if it is an opening delimiter it inserts both it and the corresponding closing delimiter (and if the region is active it insert the opening delimiter at the start and the closing delimiter at the end, wrapping the region).

I started using ~god-mode~, but I found it hard to get used to it at first: there was no easy way to check what command would be triggered by what key-sequence. 

I wrote up a ~god-mode~\-specific ~describe-key~, which translates ~god-mode~ key-sequences into commands and shows their usual description. I think it's a great way to get familiar with how the package handles keys, and it allows users to invoke ~describe-key~ without leaving god-mode (previously, most keys would just show information about the generic ~god-mode-self-insert-command~)

I also reached out to the package's maintainers, and this feature (after some tweaking) [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode][just got added to the master branch]]. It was a great way to get familiar with ~god-mode~ code and its behavior, and I'm happy to have made my first contribution to an Emacs package.

The ~git grep~ git command is great for finding a regex (or a simple string) everywhere in a git repo. I define the following functions and bind the ~git-grep~ function to ~F2~. It will prompt for a regex and search for that in the repo or, if you give it a numeric prefix like ~C-u~ it will read the current symbol at point (the word under the cursor) and search for that. Results appear in a grep buffer, so you can use ~C-g C-n~ and ~C-g C-p~ to navigate from one result to the next.

If you write Lisp, there's a couple of old Emacs commands to help you write code while keeping parenthesis balanced: ~M-(~ (~insert-parenthesis~), and ~M-)~ (~move-past-close-and-reindent~). They used to be documented in old Emacs manuals, but presumably their description was removed to make room for other content.

With a prefix argument, ~M-(~ wraps in parenthesis that number of sexps. For example with point represented as "*":

\*foo -> C-u 1 M-( -> (foo)

Sometimes I'm working on programs with functions a few pages long, and ~follow-mode~ means that I can open two windows of the same buffer side-by-side and have the text flow like a book between them. I can double or even triple the amount of lines I can view at one time.

This has largely superseded what I might have used those code-overview map things for, which is difficult anyway, since I like to use Emacs from the terminal.

It will keep the text aligned as you move through the file, and pairs well with binding ~<mouse-5>~ and ~<mouse-4>~ to the ~scroll-up/down-line~ commands in ~xterm-mouse-mode~.

If I'm studying/notetaking, I often end up with a few Emacs-windows arranged in a vertical stack. ~winner-mode~ or ~window-configuration-to-register~ are great, but if I want to quickly regain some vertical screen-real-estate without messing up the layout, then it's pretty intuitive to use ~follow-mode~ and just switch multiple windows to the same buffer, now they behave like one.

Skeletons are one of Emacs' killer features, especially when combined with ~abbrev-mode~. Here's a macro I wrote to make them a little easier to handle:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defmacro snip (name &rest skeleton)
  (let* ((snip-name (symbol-name ~,name))
         (func-name (intern (concat "snip-" snip-name))))
    ~(progn
       (define-skeleton ,func-name
         ,(concat snip-name " skeleton")
         ,@skeleton)
       (define-abbrev global-abbrev-table ,snip-name
         "" ',func-name))))

#+END_SRC
Here's a simplistic example using the macro:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(snip dd "" (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d"))

#+END_SRC
Now (assuming you have ~abbrev-mode~ enabled), type ~dd ~ into your buffer (that's ~d~ ~d~ ~SPC~) and it'll be replaced with the current date.

This is just scratching the surface, skeletons are extremely powerful. Once you start using them they become a superpower and can take your Emacs usage to the next level.

For some this will be obvious, but I'm sure there will be at least one person who will find this useful. One of the most amazing features of Emacs to me is dabbrev-expand, by default bound to M-/. 

> Expand previous word "dynamically".

> Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.
I> ifno suitable preceding word is found, words following point are
considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the
> buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable

This command is essentially omni-autocomplete. Chances are, the term you're trying to complete is in the buffer you're using or another buffer, and you can hit multiple times to cycle through different completions. I find the expander to be quicker and more deterministic than language autocomplete about 70% of the time. It's especially useful in writing, if you use Emacs for things other than programming, as you can complete proper names and specalized vocabulary quickly.

TIL that you can style the GTK components of Emacs by means of simply overriding CSS styling. There's a cool package for that ([[https://github.com/florommel/custom-css.git][custom-css on GitHub]]) but I also discovered that you can easily tweak it "in real time" and without any additional package by invoking the GTK inspector using the following function:

One thing that I really wanted to achieve was to get rounded corners in the bottom edges of an Emacs frame using GNOME. To do that it is necessary for the client-side decorations to do so. I tried applying the ~border-radius~ attribute everywhere but it won't work on the main pane due to it not being a standard GTK component. What I did was putting the toolbar in the bottom position and then apply a ~border-radius~ styling on it. I also applied the ~border-radius~ styling on the main window and on the ~decoration~ component (which gives shadowing to the frame)

https://preview.redd.it/fnf9sp6yoi3e1.png?width=1725&format=png&auto=webp&s=dca1b33886b72e32d445bb02830814357738c2f5

Now I wonder if it's possible to remove the header bar but without removing the shadow behind the frame and behind the context menus. 🤔

I've recently discovered [[https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools][~org-pdftools~]] and it offers everything I need for annotating pdfs in emacs.  I mainly use it to enhance the inbuilt function ~org-store-link~:

\* mark a passage in the pdf, run ~M-x org-store-link~, and it creates a highlight in the pdf (technically an empty annotation) and copies a link to it.
\* run ~C-c C-l~ in any org-buffer, and it pastes the link and prompts you for a name.

The installation is easy, you just need to hook it into ~org-mode~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-pdftools
    :after (org pdf-tools)
    :hook (org-mode . org-pdftools-setup-link))

#+END_SRC
The only thing to keep in mind is that the highlights in the pdf are not automatically deleted, as you delete the link in the org buffer.  You have to do that manually in the pdf (~C-c C-a l~ to list all highlights, ~D~ to delete).

It has less features than [[https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter][~org-noter~]], but it is more flexible, which is why it suits my use-case better.  Unfortunately, it has ~org-noter~ as a dependency, so you will end up loading it either way.

You know that you can use vars in org source blocks that inject some data, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 #+begin_src bash :var token="bla-bla-bla" 
 echo ${token}
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 : bla-bla-bla

#+END_SRC
That can be used to pass data from one block to another, right? So if you need to calculate something based on the result of another block, you just need a named block.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 #+name: dirs
 #+begin_src bash :results silent
 ls 
 #+end_src

 #+begin_src js :var data=dirs 
 console.log(data)
 #+end_src

#+END_SRC
But did you know, you can also use elisp there?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 #+begin_src js :var data=(if (featurep :system 'macos) "🍎" "🐧") 
 return data;
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 : 🍎

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
#+begin_src clojure :var data=(shell-command-to-string "ls -a ~")

(->>  (str/split data #"\n")

Many of you probably know of this, but I found "indirect buffers" useful.

When I'm in Vim, I've found it useful to sometimes split a buffer into two windows, and use code folding to view different parts of the same file in the two windows. But this doesn't work in Emacs, because the "folding" and "narrow" states of the buffer are synced between the windows in contrast to Vim. One concrete use case I had: I have a huge Org file, and wanted to narrow ~C-x n s~ into different headings of the file in different windows.

Indirect buffers solve this. It makes two buffers for one file, and these buffers have separate settings for folding, narrowing, etc. But the buffer contents are still synced, so there's no risk of diverging file states. With default keybindings, I found that ~C-x 4 c C-x n s~ did what I wanted.

Need to remove an element from a list when you're tinkering with elisp?

Sometimes when I'm adding and removing elements from hooks or variables like ~completion-at-point-functions~ I'll often need to tinker with the symbols I've added. You could evaluate some form somewhere, but I like to be lazy and just:

Very useful, but I keep forgetting it:

If you have two buffers open in one frame, where one contains just a few lines and otherwise just uses up a lot of space, you can shrink that buffer down just right by using: ~C-x -~

And if you want to balance these two buffers again just use ~C-x +~

Some weeks ago, u/paretoOptimalDev made an interesting post about using more ~next-buffer~ and ~previous-buffer~ instead of ~switch-to-buffer~ (https://redd.it/ybqp3m). I liked the post and had captured it for later and only now could process it properly.

The reasoning for using ~next-buffer~ and ~previous-buffer~ is good, but pretty much everyone complained about their default bindings.

It is worth noting that Emacs 28 has included ~repeat-mode~ and Emacs 29 has added ~next-buffer~ and ~previous-buffer~ to the repeat maps. So, if you're in Emacs 29, just enabling ~repeat-mode~ gets you a better behavior for this. You can start with ~C-x <right>~ and, after that, just the arrow keys get you to the next or previous buffer.

If you're still on Emacs 28, you can use:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defvar buffer-navigation-repeat-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "<right>") 'next-buffer)
    (define-key map (kbd "<left>") 'previous-buffer)
    map)
  "Keymap to repeat ~next-buffer' and ~previous-buffer'.  Used in ~repeat-mode'.")

Is there any way I can get files to open in panes 1 or 2, and always have things like magit/test-output/deadgrep/etc on pane 3? I've tried "shackle" but I've had no success with it; everything seems to open in a horizontal pane at the bottom of my screen regardless of config.

Prevent horizontal scrolling from going too far left.

I use Emacs on a laptop and quite often scroll with a touchpad. I also don't use line wrapping, as in code it usually looks misleading, so lines can sometimes exceed window width, either because of some long names or because the current window configuration is too narrow.

However, when scrolling text sideways, there's a small annoyance that the scroll can go way too far to the left. E.g. if this is your window, and your text exceeds it:


#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
|Short line             |
|Some really long line o|
|Another short line     |

#+END_SRC
What I'd like to is to prevent scrolling any further than that:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
|line                   |
|eally long line of text|
|r short line           |

#+END_SRC
But Emacs actually allows to scroll as far as one would want to, like here:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
|                       |
|t                      |
|                       |

#+END_SRC
This doesn't make sense to me, as you can't see anything at all.
Probably handy, when you write in really long lines, and you wish to have some buffer for adding more text without triggering scrolling, but I never needed that. So I wrote such predicate:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun truncated-lines-p ()
  "Non-nil if any line is longer than ~window-width' + ~window-hscroll'.

Returns t if any line exceeds the right border of the window.
Used for stopping scroll from going beyond the longest line.
Based on ~so-long-detected-long-line-p'."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let* ((window-width
            ;; this computes a more accurate width rather than ~window-width', and respects
            ;; ~text-scale-mode' font width.
            (/ (window-body-width nil t) (window-font-width)))
           (hscroll-offset
            ;; ~window-hscroll' returns columns that are not affected by
            ;; ~text-scale-mode'.  Because of that, we have to recompute the correct
            ;; ~window-hscroll' by multiplying it with a non-scaled value and
            ;; dividing it with a scaled width value, rounding it to the upper
            ;; boundary.  Since there's no way to get unscaled value, we have to get
            ;; a width of a face that is not scaled by ~text-scale-mode', such as
            ;; ~window-divider' face.
            (ceiling (/ (* (window-hscroll) (window-font-width nil 'window-divider))
                        (float (window-font-width)))))

            (if (bound-and-true-p display-line-numbers-mode)
                (- display-line-numbers-width)
              0))
           ;; subtracting 2 for extra space in case some calculations were imprecise
           (threshold (+ window-width hscroll-offset line-number-width -2)))
      (catch 'excessive

This function can calculate window width, and line width, and check if any line in the buffer exceeds the window width screen-wise. By screen-wise I mean that if you've scrolled text to the left, it will begin to return ~nil~ once all lines don't exceed the right border of the window, thus achieving the described behavior in the diagrams. I then define advice around the ~scroll-left~ function, and it works pretty good:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(define-advice scroll-left (:around (foo &optional arg set-minimum))
  (when (and truncate-lines
             (not (memq major-mode '(vterm-mode term-mode)))
             (truncated-lines-p))
    (funcall foo arg set-minimum)))

#+END_SRC
Though it's not very accurate when using ~text-scale-adjust~, as line width is not the same as before, the function, that reports how much the window was scrolled to the left still returns unscaled values. You can see my thoughts in the function's comments. Any suggestions on how to make it more accurate?

Is there a package similar to wdired or wgrep that would work on magit diffs? 

Particular use cases I have in mind are:

1. You've prepared a commit for pull request and during review someone spotted a mistake that's present in multiple files of that commit. Usually I grep the mistake and edit only affected files with wgrep (there might be some arbitrary reason to not fix similar issue in files not present in the commit).
2. In C++ it happens sometimes that you want to separate declaration and definition and in your commit you forgot to move some definitions to .cpp.
Usually I switch to ~foobar.hpp~, kill the necessary part, switch to ~foobar.cpp~, yank that part.

Checkout [[https://github.com/alphapapa/topsy.el][Topsy Mode]], it creates a header at the top of your buffer to show the name of the first function outside of your visual range. It makes scrolling through code much easier because you get an additional visual queue of your location in the buffer. It's one of those things that you never knew you wanted. It takes about 15 seconds to setup.

Imenu is pretty adictive and it's disappointing when some major mode doesn't support it. Luckily, it's fairly easy to cook up some regexps to provide imenu support in a new major mode. For example I recently noticed that customize buffers didn't have imenu support add I wrote this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun configure-imenu-Custom ()
  (setq imenu-generic-expression
        '(("Faces" "^\\(?:Show\\|Hide\\) \\(.*\\) face: \\[sample\\]" 1)
          ("Variables" "^\\(?:Show Value\\|Hide\\) \\([^:\n]*\\)" 1))))

(add-hook 'Custom-mode-hook #'configure-imenu-Custom)

#+END_SRC
One subtlety with writing this is that the customize buffers show little triangles instead of the words "Show", "Hide" or "Show Value". To figure out what text is really in the buffer you can use ~C-u C-x =~ which tells you about any overlays at point.

If you're using the mark setting commands to expand a selection like ~M-@~ (mark next word) or ~C-M-@~ (mark next sexp), you can swap the point and mark (~C-x C-x~) and the selection will be expanded to the left rather than the right.

So if you're in the middle of a sentence, you can press ~M-@~ a few times to select some words to the right, press ~C-xx~, and press ~M-@~ a few more times to add words before the selection.

This is something I'm not actively using anymore, but it was one of my I-love-emacs moments, so I wanted to share this for a while.

At work, I used to have an org-mode journal where I would take meeting notes. After the meeting, I exported the subtree for the current meeting to a PDF (via ODT) and sent it to the participants via mail.

After a while I extended org-export to get a shortcut (~C-e C-s o M~) to automatically

\* export to PDF via ODT
   * using a proper corporate design & logo via ODT\_STYLES\_FILE header
\* rename the file to include the current date
\* open thunderbird, starting a new message with
   * subject taken from document title (if exporting all) or subtree heading (if exporting subtree
   * pre-filled text
   * the exported PDF already attached

org-variable-pitch.el users might want to give [[https://github.com/casouri/valign][~valign~]] a look. It aligns your tables nicely, even with pictures (e.g. LaTeX previews) and links. The significance in context of OVP specifically is that you don't need to add ~org-link~ to ~org-variable-pitch-fixed-faces~ because valign-mode handles variable pitch links neatly in tables.

If you don't use OVP but use e.g. latex fragments in tables or just pictures, this one is still very helpful.

Kudos to the author, great little package.

On a Mac: make Emacs detect if you have light or dark mode enabled system wide.

If you have two themes, a light one and a dark one, and you want the dark theme by default unless you have light mode enabled, add this to your init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; If we're on a Mac and the file "~/bin/get_dark.osascript" exists
;; and it outputs "false", activate light mode. Otherwise activate
;; dark mode.
(cond ((and (file-exists-p "~/bin/get_dark.osascript")

(mcj/theme-set-light and mcj/theme-set-light are functions that enable the light and the dark theme, respectively).

Using [[https://github.com/mpedramfar/zotra][zotra]], [[https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar][citar]] and some parts of the Org-cite ecosystem I hacked together a highly experimental but pretty comfortable environment for working with "org-biblatex bibliographies" which are basically like [[http://gewhere.github.io/org-bibtex][org-bibtex]] but with biblatex entries represented as headings with suitable properties instead of bibtex. I have a function which retrieves a biblatex entry corresponding to an url using zotra and adds a corresponding Org heading with the biblatex fields as properties, and the entry becomes available in Citar as soon as I save the document. Citing these entries then works anywhere, even in the same document with a suitable ~#+bibliography: my-org-biblatex-file.org~ declaration. Exporting the citations also works with the CSL exporter, no conversion is necessary to a proper biblatex bibliography file (but can be easily done if one needs biblatex-based export). Since the bibliography is an Org document, tagging, agenda commands, column view etc. can all be used with the bibliography entries.  In a way it's frightening how much can be achieved building on already existing stuff and with a few lines of Emacs Lisp.

\**Create Rectangular Selection with Meta+Click+Drag**

By default, when you click and drag with the Meta key Emacs creates what it calls a "secondary selection" which is super interesting and useful, but not what this tip is about. In most editors (on the Mac anyway) option+click+drag is used to create a rectangular selection. Emacs, of course, supports this, you just need to remap it.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-set-key [M-down-mouse-1] #'mouse-drag-region-rectangle)
(global-set-key [M-drag-mouse-1] #'ignore)
(global-set-key [M-mouse-1]      #'mouse-set-point)

#+END_SRC
You can also create a rectangular selection with the command ~rectangle-mark-mode~.

Don't forget to bind ~replace-rectangle~ to something convenient for super easy editing.

I posted this in the emacsclient thread, but I think it deserves to live here as well:


The emacsclient / server system is great.  If you have it listening on tcp and port forward that when connecting to remote machine it adds another level of power.

I use [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][emacs-vterm]] for a terminal inside emacs, so I've got a lot of commands remapped.  Like ~man~ runs ~emacsclient ... man ..~, which opens the man page in the "other" buffer, so it doesn't interrupt my flow.  I use "scroll-other-window" to navigate the man page while I still have my prompt. ~magit~, ~dired~, and others map to their ~emacsclient~ equivalents.

I've written wrapper script for e/emacs client that I've come to call ~e~, because it saves keystrokes

#### [[https://gitlab.com/zackallison/e-emacs/][The full repo is here e-emacs.sh]]

It does the standard things you would expect, starts emacs if it's not already started, open a file in a new buffer / window / terminal and optionally wait for you to finish or have the shell continue.

Then I added some functions that I found useful, starting with piping results from a command into an emacs buffer, such as ~find . -name foo\* | e~.  Naturally after that was piping from a buffer to a command: ~e [file] | rot13~ super secure encryption.  And of course piping into and out of a buffer works as well ~find . -name incriminating-evidence\* | e | xargs rm~, so you can verify / tweak the results before passing them through.  Maybe you want to leave the evidence on Two Time Tommy.  Who knows.

The other nice feature is the ability to use templates.  For example to edit a HTTP request and then send it to a server you can do that: ~e -t header_template.txt | nc www.example.com 80~  The template file is copied to a temp file which is the one that is edited.

Or the poor man's blog system: ~e -t header_template.html body_template.html footer.html > new_page.html~

See the repo for more examples and to download.  The notes of getting it working on remote machines aren't the cleanest.  If you have any suggestions or features that would make your life easier let me know; submit an issue or comment here.

Elisp list indentation has been fixed since over two years ago (https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=21922).  A lot of people probably still use an initfile hack, to fix the following problem, that lists would indent like this:

I used to have a problem where eglot would decide that many mid-hierarchy directories were the project root and spin up a separate instance of clangd for each one (sometimes 10 or 12 total). This was almost certainly due to using emacs' built-in ~project~ to handle project discovery. At that point, I switched to lsp-mode because I generally find ~project~ to be impenetrable and poorly documented compared to projectile.

I was forced to go back to eglot, however, because lsp-mode has been failing to parse things well for a while.

Long story short, here's how you force ~project~ to find the actual project root if the automatic detection doesn't work. With this, eglot started working great, didn't spin up 10 instances of clangd, and has generally been ticking over just fine.

I used to always get confused why people say that the default Emacs key bindings hurt their pinky's, but then I realized that I don't touch type and thus I don't have to stretch my fingers anywhere for the default key bindings. Ironically my ineptitude at typing has saved me from repetitive stress injuries.

I found myself debugging [[https://jwt.io][JWTs]] earlier this week and whomped up a little function to decode them from a region into a help buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun ii/decode-jwt (start end &optional jwt)
  "Decode JWT in region and print to help buffer."
  (interactive "r")
  (let* ((tok (if jwt jwt
            (buffer-substring start end)))
     (data (s-split "\\." tok))
     (header (car data))
     (claims (cadr data)))
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert (format "%s\n\n%s"
                  (base64-decode-string header t)
                  (base64-decode-string claims t)))
  (json-pretty-print-buffer)
  (with-output-to-temp-buffer "*JWT*"
    (princ (buffer-string)))))
  t)
#+END_SRC

I'd forgotten about ~with-output-to-temp-buffer~ which is pretty handy.  The ~t~ at the end is there just to suppress an overly large echo area message.

(This should be obvious but note that the JWT is not validated or verified.  This is intended for debugging only and the JWT should not be trusted.)

I'm once again reminded of the utility of ~read-key~ for small functions where one wants a nicer interface for choosing an alternative than universal arguments; taking an optional prompt, it simply reads a key from the keyboard and returns it.

For example, I recently wanted a function that prints a set of predefined dates for me into the current buffer, and it was as easy as

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun slot/insert-time ()

  (let* ((formats '((?i "ISO 8601"  "%Y-%m-%d")
                    (?l "DDmmmYYYY" "%d%b%Y")
                    (?t "Time"      "%H:%M")))
         (key (read-key
               (cl-loop for (key label _) in formats
                        concat (format "[%s] %s "
                                       (propertize (single-key-description key) 'face 'bold)

I put a couple of similar functions on my ~<f5>~ key (with all combinations of modifier keys) and tend to forget the meanings of those combinations.

So I made a small function to give some help for a list of keybindings.:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-generate-keybind-doc-on-keys (&rest keys)
  "generate help on some given  keybindings (kbd style)."
  (substring
   (apply #'concat
          (mapcar #'(lambda (key)
                      (let* ((fun (key-binding (kbd key)))
                             (fun-name (symbol-name fun))
                             (doc (documentation fun 'raw))
                             (oneline (substring doc 0 (string-match "\n" doc))))
                        (put-text-property 0 (length key) 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face key)
                        (put-text-property 0 (length fun-name) 'face 'font-lock-function-name-face fun-name)
                        (put-text-property 0 (length oneline) 'face 'font-lock-doc-face oneline)
                        (format "%10s : %-30s → %s\n" key fun-name oneline)))
                  keys))
   0 -1))

#+END_SRC
To show that help in the echo buffer, one needs to define a command, which can be bound to a key:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-show-help-on-some-keys ()
  "demo generate help on 3 keys"
  (interactive)
  (message (my-generate-keybind-doc-on-keys "C-s"
                                            "<f1> k"
                                            "C-c !")))

#+END_SRC
Then calling the command ~my-show-help-on-some-keys~, shows following message in the echo buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   C-s : isearch-forward                → Do incremental search forward.
<f1> k : helpful-key                    → Show help for interactive command bound to KEY-SEQUENCE.
 C-c ! : shell-here                     → Open a shell relative to default-directory.


#+END_SRC
Remark: I know that ~which-key~ exists, but I'm already above that level of knowledge and don't need ~which-key~ anymore.

Maybe not new for anyone but I only recently found out that ~C-c <any letter>~ is conventionally reserved for user bindings. I was constantly afraid to define my own bindings bc of a potential clash so tended to use M-x instead. Now I finally bind my most used commands.

With the above in mind, Im also afraid to forget my bindings. I use which-key package so I wrote a function "define-my-keybinding letter fn" which binds the letter to ~C-c <letter>~ and to "my-bindings" keyset (prefix) which itself is bound to ~C-c m~. Basically, if i forget what bindings I use, I just press C-c m and which-key shows me all of MY bindings (yes, it shows them with C-c too but it's mixed with mode bindings so not helpful)

I spent the past week cleaning up my Emacs init files and I bumped into this little gem.  I call it "ZSH man page search mode" because it was the place that I first needed it.

I do ~M-x man zshall(1)~ fairly frequently (and don't forget to ~widen~ so you can see all of the pages).  Then I would start searching for what I was looking for.  The man page is nicely structured so if I wanted to find "foo", search for "foo" had too many hits.  What I wanted to find was the place where "foo" is described.

This little search does the trick.  It is probably useful for other man pages and perhaps even other places but for now... I call it "ZSH man page search"

Enjoy!

#+BEGIN_SRC elisplisp

Here's a little solution to a minor complaint about `isearch` that I think is fairly common.

# The Problem

TLDR: See [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32373/go-to-start-of-search-string-after-ret][this old StackExchange question]]

Often, I'll want to go to a precise location in a buffer to correct a typo. If that location is behind point (as it usually is if I notice the typo shortly after entering it), then `isearch-backward` works great. You press "C-r" and type some characters starting with your target until the location becomes the current result.  As soon as the cursor jumps to your target location, you can use an editing command like "C-t", which exits isearch automatically for you. Or you can press "C-m" to exit isearch-mode and then start inserting text at that location. Wonderful!

But it's a little less perfect when your target is *after* point. This is because with `isearch-forward`, point lands at the end of your search result, instead of the beginning as it does with `isearch-backward`.

You could type your search starting with some arbitrary number of characters in front of the target. But then you have to decide in advance how many characters to use, and if you don't use enough, there might be too many results. And then if you have to keep typing past your target character to sufficiently narrow the results, point won't land where you want it.

Another strategy would be to do the same thing as when searching backwards, start with the target character and just type characters until your target location is selected. But now point is at the other end of the result, instead of where you want it. "M-b" would exit and move point to the beginning of the word, but that assumes there are no word boundaries in your search result, and besides, your actual target won't always be the beginning of a word. Often it will be somewhere in the middle of a word.

Or you could use C-r to move point to the beginning of the result. But then you still have to press C-m to exit the search and start inserting text at that location. And that's 2 key-presses just to finish your search, not to mention all the key-presses you did to start.

So we can fix this.

# My Solution

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my/isearch-bor-exit ()
  "Ensure point is at beginning of isearch result, then exit."
  (interactive)
  (when (< isearch-other-end (point))
    (goto-char isearch-other-end))
  (call-interactively 'isearch-exit))
    
(define-key isearch-mode-map ?\M-m 'my/isearch-bor-exit)

#+END_SRC
So now if I'm using isearch to get to a precise location (as opposed to just searching for a word), I can type beginning with the character at the target location, stop typing after it becomes part of the result, and press "M-m" to exit the search and make my correction. No more having to stop and think about whether I'm going backwards or forwards and whether I'll have to move point back before exiting isearch.

# The Conclusion

A minor problem with a fairly simple solution, but it made me happy to stop and solve it.

I think I'll be using isearch now for a lot of things that I used to use Avy for.  But Avy is still great for a bunch of reasons. Not the least of which is the `avy-isearch` command which comes in handy when there are a lot of isearch results that would require too much typing to narrow down. (And it always puts point at the beginning of the result, never at the end).

So C-<tab> expands a snippet within a snippet, and everything just worked as I'd hoped.  Once I'm done with the nested expansion <TAB> just moves on to the outer one. \*shrug\*

A tiny thing I just noticed: in ~tex-mode~, you can create a new environment with ~C-c C-e~. With the universal argument (~C-u C-c C-e~), however, you can easily change any environment into another.

I created an ~enumerate~ environment and immediately changed my mind. By chance, I intuitively tried the aforementioned command and I was instantly able to change the environment into ~itemize~.

(Nothing too fancy, I'm sure a lot of people have a similar thing in their toolbox, but it was useful to me again today.)

When writing elisp packages, the compiler expects that all variables and functions are declared. Declaring variables defined somewhere else is easy, one just needs to \~defvar\~ them, but declaring functions should mention the file where it is defined.

Inserting all those forms is tedious, especially if the function comes from a package with several files. But emacs already knows where the function comes from, so we can just ask it.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun tv/add-declare-function (fun)
  (interactive "a") 
  (let* ((buf (car (find-function-noselect fun))) 
         (name (file-name-base (buffer-file-name buf)))) 
    (insert (format "(declare-function %s "%s")\n" fun name))))

#+END_SRC
Call it with M-x, insert the name of the function you want to declare (with completion), and voilà.

A colleague just showed me Intellij's "[[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/comparing-files-and-folders.html#clipboard][compare with clipboard]]" feature: it's fairly neat, you select a region, invoke compare-with-clipboard and get a diff of the two selections.

It didn't take me long to implement something similar:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun ediff-compare-region-clipboard (begin end)
  (interactive "r")
  (save-excursion
    (let ((selected-region (buffer-substring begin end))
          (clipboard-buffer (get-buffer-create "*ediff-clipboard*"))
          (region-buffer (get-buffer-create "*ediff-region*")))
      (with-current-buffer clipboard-buffer
        (insert (car kill-ring)))
      (with-current-buffer region-buffer
        (insert selected-region))
      (ediff-buffers clipboard-buffer region-buffer))))

#+END_SRC
It's not ideal though.  In particular, is there a better way to insert the "clipboard"?  One thing I quickly found was that you might copy the region to compare but then so many editing commands will add to the kill-ring, so I might want to make that part of the process interactive.

This is a very simple function, but it has saved me from countless of "do I have to do _this_ again now?" moments.

When editing LaTeX files I often find myself wanting to convert inline math to display math, in order for equations to "pop out" more.  I could not find anything already implemented, so I wrote something that does this whenever the point is inside an inline math (`$`-based, sorry `\( \)` gang) environment: 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun slot/inline-to-display-math ()
  "Transform inline math to display math."
  (interactive)
  (when (and (texmathp) (equal "$" (car texmathp-why))) ; inline math?
    (let* ((beg   (save-excursion (search-backward "$")))
           (end-$ (search-forward "$"))
           (end   (if (-contains? '(?. ?,) (char-after end-$))
                      (1+ end-$)    ; put punctuation into display-maths
                    end-$)))
      (kill-region beg end)
      ;; insert display math
      (TeX-newline)
      (insert "\\[")
      (TeX-newline)
      (insert-for-yank (string-replace "$" "" (current-kill 0)))
      (TeX-newline)
      (insert "\\]")
      (TeX-newline))))

#+END_SRC
For example, this would transform 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
The cowedge $\iota \colon P \xRightarrow{\; .. \;} C$ is easily seen to be unique up to unique isomorphism.

#+END_SRC
into 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
The cowedge
\[
  \iota \colon P \xRightarrow{\; .. \;} C
\]
is easily seen to be unique up to unique isomorphism.

#+END_SRC
I'm a bit surprised by my not finding any function to already insert some string into the simple `\[ \]`-based display math; everything I could find just inserted dollars instead.  I suppose one could insert a `displaymath` environment, but I've never like the look of that.  Oh well.

This one is probably pretty niche but it was a noticeable improvement in my workflow, so I thought I'd share. I sometimes have to fill out forms I get in PDF but that aren't fillable PDFs, merely scans of paper forms. I guess a reasonable person would install The Gimp or something like that, but I fill them out in LaTeX, using ~\includegraphics~ for the PDF form, and the ~textpos~ package to place text on top of it. 

This is requires giving the coordinates you want the text placed at, which I used to do by trial and error. And as much as I normally dislike the mouse, I had to admit that for specifying a point in an image it is a much better input device than the keyboard. So I decided to write a function that would let me click on a point in a PDF and insert the coordinates in centimeters at point in the current buffer. Writing it was fairly easy and I think really illustrates the power of a system like Emacs, a Lisp Machine or Smalltalk, where you can instantly find the source code implementing any given functionality. I knew that ~pdf-tools~ must contain some code to translate mouse clicks into PDF document coordinates, because it lets you place annotations by clicking. I have the text annotation function bound to ~a t~, and quick ~C-h k~ later I was reading the source code. And after that writing the following function was pretty easy:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun insert-coordinates ()
  "Insert coordinates (in centimeters) of mouse click."
  (interactive)
  (let ((pos (event-start (pdf-util-read-click-event "Click on PDF"))))
    (insert
     (with-selected-window (posn-window pos)
       (let ((pt (pdf-util-scale-pixel-to-points (posn-object-x-y pos))))
         (cl-flet ((f (x) (* 2.54 (/ x 72.0))))
           (format "(%.1fcm,%.1fcm)" (f (car pt)) (f (cdr pt)))))))))

Here's a really simple one, but I find it invaluable.

It took me about 30 years to realise that using C-u with ~buffer-menu~ (C-x C-b) doesn't show 'special' buffers like ~*Messages*~. Less clutter when I want to switch to a file, which is most of the time.

It then took me a few more years to realise that that's my preferred mode, so I created this simple thing to invert the sense - now C-x C-b only shows me files, and I prefix that with C-u to show special buffers too. Sounds stupid and trivial but it floats my boat.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b")        '(lambda (&optional arg)
                                          "runs buffer-menu but with the sense of C-u inverted (ie files-only unless C-u is given)"
                                          (interactive "P")
                                          (setq arg (not arg))
                                          (buffer-menu arg)))

I created a "smart" enter function for C/C++ mode. Here's what it does:

\* if you press it on a ~for~/~if~/~else~/~switch~ (no matter where the cursor is on the line) it will put ~{~, an empty line and ~}~, and will move the cursor into the body
\* if you press it on a ~struct~/~class~, it's similar to the previous case, but it puts a closing semicolon too.
\* otherwise it will put a ~;~, and a newline
\* if the ~{~, ~;~ or an empty line is already there, it won't put them again
\* In comments, it will put an indented line, without continuing the comment (I configured my RET to continue commenting, so I use M-RET when I want to close the comment)

It is useful with smartparens, because you don't have to skip the closing ~)~ all the time. For example, if you start writing an ~if~ (cursor is ~|~, the closing ~)~ was put by smartparens):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
if (expr|)

#+END_SRC
Then press M-RET, this will be the result:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
if (expr) {
    |
}

#+END_SRC
Since I created this function I use it all the time, I almost never press ~{~ ~}~ or ~;~.

At function signatures, it cannot figure out whether you want to create a declaration (closed by ~;~) or definition (closed by ~{ }~), so it puts a ~;~. And the function has a parameter (~force-curly~) with which you can force putting a~{~ (I mapped this to M-S-return).

Here's the code, maybe there can be a lot of improvements:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-cc-mode-M-RET-context (force-curly)

         (if force-curly 'curly

I follow the format of ~{ticketnumber}-{short-description}~ when creating branches using Magit, but when typing the descriptive name for the branch I often type ~SPC~ between words instead of dash due to muscle memory when writing sentences.

AucTex users: You're missing out if you don't use [[https://github.com/cdominik/cdlatex][CDLatex]]. It's primarily a fast input tool for LaTeX, sort of like snippet templates. The difference between setting up Yasnippet templates for LaTeX and CDLatex is that CDLaTeX's TAB key to jump past stuff is _always available_, not just during snippet entry. It's difficult to explain, so here are some demos:

1. [[https://gfycat.com/heavenlynegligiblehoiho][Fast input with cdlatex and preview.el]]
2. [[https://gfycat.com/safeidolizedlangur][Fast input with keys displayed]]

CDLaTeX was written by Carsten Dominik, the author of Org-mode and reftex. Thus Org ships with an ~org-cdlatex~ minor-mode that makes these features available in org-mode.

One thing I found cool is that you can actually use modifiers like **Super and Hyper in terminal Emacs**. It even works over SSH. No changes needed to ~init.el~.

The trick is that Emacs has built-in keybindings like ~C-x @ s~ that simulates a super modifier and ~C-x @ h~ that simulates a hyper modifier. So if you press e.g. ~C-x @ s a~, then Emacs will interpret that as super+a.

Terminals like e.g. Kitty lets you bind super+a to do whatever you want, so you can simply map it to send the key sequences that Emacs expects. Just add this to e.g. ~kitty.conf~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
map super+a send_key ctrl+x @ s a
map super+b send_key ctrl+x @ s b
...
#+END_SRC
And voila, super works fine in ~emacs -nw~! Kitty translates ~s-a~ into normal terminal-supported control keybindings ~C-x @ s a~, which Emacs then translates back into ~s-a~.

I often do simple manuals with a lot of screenshots, now in ~org~.

So I came up with the ~org/insert-screenshot~ command that works in windows and linux (wayland with ~wl-paste~ available):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun org/insert-screenshot ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((img-dir (concat "img-"
                          (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-name))))
         (img-name (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-name))
                           "-" (format-time-string "%Y%m%d-%H%M%S") ".png"))
         (filename (concat img-dir "/" img-name)))
    (make-directory img-dir :parents)
    ;; Windows -- use powershell, other(implicit linux) -- use wl-paste
    (shell-command
     (if (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
         (concat
          "powershell -command \"Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms;"
          "if ($([System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard]::ContainsImage()))"
          "{$image = [System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard]::GetImage();"
          "[System.Drawing.Bitmap]$image.Save('"
          filename
          "',[System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat]::Png);}\"")
       (concat "wl-paste > " filename)))
    (insert (concat "[[file:" filename "]]"))))
    
#+END_SRC
So the flow is:

1. make a screenshot using OS
2. goto org document (~doc1.org~ for example)
3. ~M-x org/insert-screenshot RET~
4. image file is saved under ~./img-doc1/doc1-20230525-100621.png~
5. link is inserted into org document

recently started writing a report with a lot of numbers, many of which will change in later versions. I wanted to save myself the work of updating them all by hand, so I learned that I can [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/14647/use-code-variable-in-org-mode-continuous-text][generate org macros from my ~R~ script]], [[https://notes.alexkehayias.com/emacs-inline-macro-in-the-buffer/][display their values rather than the macro text]], and pass ~org-macro-templates~ to ~consult--read~ to select and insert them with a few keystrokes. took me a couple of hours but hopefully will save them later on!

I love using `dabbrev-expand` (bound by default to `M-/`) to complete text I know is in one of my buffers. It completes one word at a time, but if you want to keep pulling subsequent words from the location where a completion is found you can insert a space and run `dabbrev-expand` again, so `SPC M-/`.

For example if you have the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" in some buffer (and say no other "qu" appears anywhere in your buffers), then `qu M-/ SPC M-/ SPC M-/` will insert "quick brown fox".

This is already great, but I find the key sequence `SPC M-/` awkward to type so I wrote this little function which I bind to `M-'`:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun dabbrev-next (arg)
  "Insert the next ARG words from where previous expansion was found."
  (interactive "p")
  (dotimes (_ arg)
    (insert " ")
    (dabbrev-expand 1)))
    
#+END_SRC
Then for "quick grown fox" I can go `qu M-/ M-' M-'` which feels much easier to type (on my keyboard `/` and `'` are very close to each other).

(`M-'` is bound by default to `abbrev-prefix-mark` which I never use, so I didn't mind rebinding it.)

Make a little mode called ~my-minor-mode~ and enable it globally. Use it's keymap for your keybindings, without the prefix.  Then assign that keymap to a prefix. This way, you can disable most of your keybindings easily when needed, you can easily switch your prefix key (e.g. go from ~C-c~ to ~H-x~ or ~<menu>~, etc.), have those keybindings available on multiple prefixes, and you can easily restore a default keybinding via ~(define-key my-minor-mode-map <key> nil)~.  Here is how I define a minor mode for myself:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; The GK minor mode:
    
;; The GK minor mode is at the heart of this configuration.  Almost
;; all keybindings, except unmapping some keys from the global map,
;; and except bindings in specific modes, should be done with this
;; minor modes keymap.  This minor mode is active everywhere, except
;; the Minibuffer and the Fundamental mode buffers.
    
(defgroup GK nil
  "Group for my configuration."
  :group 'emacs
  :prefix "gk-")
    
(defvar gk-minor-mode-map
  (make-sparse-keymap)
  "Where to put all my bindings.")
    
(defvar gk-minor-mode-prefix-map
  (make-sparse-keymap)
  "Prefix map for my bindings.")
    
(fset 'gk-minor-mode-prefix-map gk-minor-mode-prefix-map)
    
(defvar gk-minor-mode-prefix "\C-c"
  "Keymap prefix for ~gk-minor-mode'.")
    
(define-minor-mode gk-minor-mode
  "Global minor mode for customisations.
    
\\{gk-minor-mode-map}"
  nil "" gk-minor-mode-map
  (let ((map gk-minor-mode-map))
    (define-key map gk-minor-mode-prefix #'gk-minor-mode-prefix-map)))
    
(define-globalized-minor-mode global-gk-minor-mode gk-minor-mode
  gk-minor-mode)

#+END_SRC
Then just enable it somewhere. I like to use the following setup for enabling global modes at once:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;;; Global modes:
    
;; This module provides utilities for global modes, like turning them on
;; and off collectively with a single command, registering and
;; unregistering them, disabling default modes etc.
    
;; All the modes listed in =gk-global-modes= are toggled on with an
;; =after-init-hook=, so modifications to this variable that happen up
;; until the execution of the named hook will actually determine which
;; modes are turned on.
    
;; =gk-disabled-modes= is a list of modes to disable.
    
;; Each of this lists contain symbols, actually =*-mode= functions.  The
;; ones in the former will be called with =+1= as the argument, and ones
;; in the latter with =-1=.
    
;; Do not use this as a hook, add to =after-init-hook= instead.
    
(defvar gk-global-modes nil "List of global modes to be enabled.")
(defvar gk-disabled-modes nil "List of disabled global modes.")
    
(defvar gk-toggle-global-modes nil)
(defun gk-toggle-global-modes ()
  "Enable or disable the modes listed in ~gk-global-modes' at once."
  (interactive)
  (setf gk-toggle-global-modes (not gk-toggle-global-modes))
  (let (errors)
    ;; Enable global modes
    (dolist (mode gk-global-modes)
      (condition-case e
          (funcall mode (if gk-toggle-global-modes 1 -1))
        (error (push ~(,mode ,e) errors))))
    ;; Disable modes in gk-disabled-modes
    (dolist (mode gk-disabled-modes)
      (condition-case e
          (funcall mode (if gk-toggle-global-modes -1 1))
        (error (push ~(,mode ,e) errors))))
    (when errors
      (warn "Following errors occurred when activating global modes:\n%S"
            errors))))
    
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'gk-toggle-global-modes)

#+END_SRC
~~That function needs some updating tho. But it works fine as a hook that sets up the global modes.~~ I put ~global-gk-minor-mode~ into ~gk-global-modes~ and it's enabled alongside some other ones.

Edit: fix ~gk-toggle-global-modes~.

I've been playing around with Emacs 28's [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/lisp?id=12409c9064c386a496dcbdca76b790108f6c1cad][repeat-mode]] a bit.  It allows for not having to press modifiers when executing several conceptually similar actions in a row.  Sadly, the ergonomics of defining these repeat maps are not quite there yet, so I wrote a small macro (my first one ever, actually!) to define the map and set the appropriate symbol property for the function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defmacro defrepeatmap (symbol &optional pairs docstring)
  "A macro for defining ~repeat-map's.
Defines a new repeat-map called SYMBOL with the given DOCSTRING.
The keys are derived via the list PAIRS, whose elements are cons
cells of the form (KEY . DEF), where KEY and DEF must fulfill the
same requirements as if given to ~define-key'."
  ~(progn
     (defvar ,symbol
       (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
         (--each ,pairs (define-key map (car it) (cdr it)))
         map)
       ,docstring)
     ;; Tell the keys they are in a repeat map.
     (--each (mapcar 'cdr (cdr ,symbol))
       (put it 'repeat-map ',symbol))))
       
#+END_SRC
It can be used like 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defrepeatmap window-repeat-map
  '(("}" . enlarge-window-horizontally)
    ("{" . shrink-window-horizontally )
    ("+" . balance-windows            )

I use this often when working on large files. You can bookmark up to 9 places inside a file and jump to that position. The limitations is that if you add somehing above the bookmark the position is shifted a bit but it's not that hard to find the right place.

It works like this: ~C-c 0~ creates a bookmark and ~C-c <1-9>~ jumps into a bookmark. I've written about this on my old blog. I still use this from time to time.

I use EXWM mode, so I can use Emacs' excellent window managing functionality universally with my standard applications like Firefox.

Firefox, like most web browsers nowadays, has tabs. But tabs are vastly inferior to Emacs' built in buffer management, and I don't think the abstraction belongs at the application level, instead it should be implemented once universally so it can be used with all applications. I think tabs became popular because window managers failed at effectively managing a large number of browser windows.

I use Firefox with the tab bar hidden, and with an extension which will open every new tab in a new window automatically. Now I can use my buffer switching commands like usual, across the 100s of Firefox windows I have, and it works like a breeze. Whatever improvements I add to help me manage buffers, automatically apply to Firefox. For example I recently enabled `midnight-mode` to clean up old buffers that I haven't visited in a few days, and I now have this automatically for Firefox too (I'm bad at manually closing webpages once I open them).

Now, onto my tip/trick. I wanted ibuffer to display the URL of each Firefox window as the file name. So I can search by the window name, or by the URL, while keeping them separated. The file name seems appropriate here as it would otherwise be empty.

To do this, I found an extension that adds the current URL to Firefox's title (I used https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepass-helper-url-in-title/, but any would work), I then wrote the following function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun b3n-exwm-set-buffer-name ()
  (if (and exwm-title (string-match "\\`http[^ ]+" exwm-title))
    (let ((url (match-string 0 exwm-title)))
      (setq-local buffer-file-name url)
      (setq-local exwm-title (replace-regexp-in-string
                              (concat (regexp-quote url) " - ")
                              ""
                              exwm-title))))

  (setq-local exwm-title
              (concat
               exwm-class-name
               "<"
               (if (<= (length exwm-title) 50)
                   exwm-title
                 (concat (substring exwm-title 0 50) "…"))
               ">"))

  (exwm-workspace-rename-buffer exwm-title))

#+END_SRC
I then added this function to the `exwm-update-class-hook` and `exwm-update-title-hook` hooks.

Now, in ibuffer, it looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  Firefox<Weekly tips/trick/etc/ thread : emacs — Mozilla Fi…> https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/mb8u1m/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/

#+END_SRC
With the buffer name on the left, and the file name (URL) on the right. Perfect :)

I will make some more improvements in the coming days, so if I split the window with `C-x 3` it duplicates the current window, so it works similar to a regular Emacs buffer and I can scroll to different points on the same page. EXWM should make this easy enough with simulation keys.

For a while, I've been thinking about a nice way to get arbitrary tooltips in org mode. I just figured out something pretty easy: just use a nonexistent link type.

I don't care about the follow behavior, or export -- just showing the tooltip under the house, or in the help-echo area, so if I do something like

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
[[abbrev:this stands for Some Random Acronym][SRA]]

#+END_SRC
the buffer shows "SRA" as an org link, and when point or the mouse is over it, I get the expected message. There's nothing special about "abbrev", except that it hasn't been defined as an org link type. If I try to follow the link, org tries to create a heading, but for such things, I'm not going to follow the link, or export it, so that behavior doesn't matter.

Another use is for footnote-style things: say, in a table you want a cell where you can add some kind of note or comment, but don't want the cell to be very big. You can make your table like this:


#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
| col A | notes |
|-------+-------|
|  1234 | [[whatever:this is a note or comment about this row in the table][note]]  |
|       |       |

#+END_SRC
and the cell just says "note", but I can see the rest when I hover.

To get the link target -- the note, the abbreviation, and so on -- to display in the help-echo area, you'll need to set ~help-at-pt-display-when-idle~ suitably: see https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/54319/how-to-display-target-of-an-org-mode-link-in-the-echo-area-or-as-tooltip.

The [[https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/wiki/Tab-completion][texdoc]] CLI program provided by TeXLive allows opening the documentation of LaTeX packages given a package name as its argument (requires having the documentation installed locally). It is available from AUCTeX via the ~TeX-documentation-texdoc~ command, which I find useful. However, it requires typing out the package name by hand (though it uses symbol-at-point as the default). Recently I found that the texdoc wiki contains a snippet how to add [[https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/wiki/Tab-completion][tab-completion]], which showed me where to get a list of installed TeXLive package names. I ported this to emacs lisp, and combined with ~completing-read~ and ~call-process~ to call the terminal command I created my own ~my-texdoc~ command with interactive candidate selection. It's available as [[https://gist.github.com/meliache/e645bf50c6aeac8e6e58b92c6bddac20][github gist here]], but I can also paste the code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-texdoc--get-package-list ()
  (let ((tlpdb-fpath (file-name-concat
                      (string-trim-right
                       (shell-command-to-string "kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFROOT"))
                      "tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb"))
        (name-regex "^name \\([^ \n.]+\\)$"))
    (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect tlpdb-fpath 'nowarn 'rawfile)
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (cl-loop
         while (re-search-forward name-regex nil 'noerror)
         collect (match-string-no-properties 1))))))
    
(defun my-texdoc (pkg)
  "Show TeX documentation for package PKG.
If called interactively, select package from TexLive with interactive completion."
  (interactive
   (list (completing-read
          "texdoc: "
          (my-texdoc--get-package-list)
          nil nil nil
          'my-texdoc-history)))
    (call-process "texdoc" nil " *texdoc*" nil "--view" pkg))

My biggest problem is that I'm not sure how to share it with the emacs community, it doesn't seem like it's big enough to be its own package, I might post it on some wiki or in some aggregating package like ~consult~, but I thought I would start with this reddit thread. I also might try to merge this into ~AUCTeX~, however I'm not sure if that's actively developed anymore and the ~TeX-documentation-texdoc~ source code is much more complex than what I have, that I'm a bit worried to break something.

And to make this post a real tip: If you know some CLI program and can somehow get a list of possible arguments for that program, try writing your own emacs lisp command wrapper with ~completing-read~ support, it's fun and not that hard.

Just found out about the variable ~confirm-kill-emacs~.  Never again will I quit emacs by accident, because auctex bound a frequently used function to ~C-c C-v~ (one key away from ~C-x C-c~).

Context: after finally getting into org-mode (org-roam specifically) and writing a bunch of elisp, I still dot not at all satisfy dealing with *org-table* or *table.el*, it just felt so out-of-place and clunky compare to the otherwise slick experiences that org-mode bring. So I basically gave up and have been linking spreadsheet files into my org files instead.

Obviously, this isn't ideal, as I need to view tables in separated libreoffice calc windows. And the notes is not viewable on GitLab or GitHub, etc.

So I decided to leverage org-babel to render spreadsheets inside my org notes.

For that, I created a bash script called emacs_excel_to_png that utilize ssconvert, ImageMagick, and Firefox. The script converts the spreadsheet into HTML, then the HTML is rendered by Firefox and finally ImageMagick will be used to crop the rendered image. The script will then print an org-link so that the image is showed the result section.

With that, in an org file, we can do something as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
#+begin_src bash :dir ./ :results raw :var ZOOM=1.3
export ZOOM; emacs_excel_to_png \
    "note_files/emacs_excel_to_png.xlsx" \
    "note_files/emacs_excel_to_png.png"
#+end_src

#+END_SRC
The content of the emacs_excel_to_png script can be found below:

I've been unhappy with the behavior of ~comment-line~ moving the point down a line, and sometimes inexplicably commenting an inactive region. I'm also unhappy with ~comment-dwim~'s single-line behavior of adding a comment at the end of the line. What I want is a function to comment/uncomment the region if its active, and comment/uncomment the line at point otherwise, so I made this quick little function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my/comment-dwim ()
  "Comment region if active, else comment line.

This avoids the excess region commenting of ~comment-line' while also avoiding the weird single-line
behavior of ~comment-dwim'."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (if (use-region-p)
        (call-interactively #'comment-or-uncomment-region)
      (call-interactively #'comment-line))))

This function clears a comint-mode buffer in a dwim fashion by preserving the current input line and working even if the cursor is above the input line. I have been using it with shell-mode and ielm bound to ~C-l~ and it works nicely.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my/comint-clear ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((orig-ln (line-number-at-pos))
        (col (current-column))
        (cmd (progn (end-of-buffer)
                    (move-end-of-line nil)
                    (set-mark (point))
                    (move-beginning-of-line nil)
                    (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))))
        (after-ln (line-number-at-pos)))
    (delete-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
    (comint-clear-buffer)
    (insert cmd)
    (if (= orig-ln after-ln)
        (move-to-column col t)
      (move-beginning-of-line nil))))
