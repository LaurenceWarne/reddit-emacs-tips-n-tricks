This is why I disagree with the subreddits de facto advice to ‚Äúlearn vanilla first‚Äù. People who have used emacs for a long time don‚Äôt realize how much **time** it takes to get it to level of a normal modern editor people are used to. I recommend distros to *everyone* who is new unless they are that certain personality type that wants to do everything themselves.

I just discovered calc mode. Oh my ...
It does symbolic differentiation, solves linear equations, plots with gnuplot, and does matrix operations, all with a few key strokes!! How is this amazing tool not as popular as org mode or Magit?? I am so excited to explore it more, especially for the "display" options. I can see it taking my latex experience to the next level. 
Any tips on using calc mode?

I often use the compile feature to compile and run my projects to see the results in the compilation buffer. This works well unless you are waiting for user input in your terminal. I recently found out that you can invoke the compile with an additional non nil value to start compilation in comint-mode which allows for user input! 
The drawback is, that you then no longer can press q to close the window or g to recompile. Because of that I added a simple lambda, that switches to compilation-mode to the compilation-finish-functions. So I can give input while compiling and running, and after compilation I can close the window as usual with q.

There are basically two paradigms you can use with Org:

1.  Flat files.  Every heading is a top-level heading.  Use tags, properties, etc. on each one.
2.  Hierarchy.  e.g. datetrees, or manually organized trees.  Tags and properties can apply to entire subtrees.

The issue, as you know, is that cataloging data is time-consuming (just ask a librarian, I guess).  It's easy to spend more time organizing data than inputting or reading it.

So I recommend a hybrid, so to speak.  

*  Use manual hierarchies where it makes sense for you.  e.g. I have a reference file that I put information I want to keep long-term, with hierarchies like Computers/Software/Emacs/Tips.
*  Use flat files where it makes sense.  I have an inbox.org file that's just a long list of top-level headings (that I will supposedly refile to their proper location someday, but mostly I just search the file).
*  Use datetrees where it makes sense.  I have a log.org file that acts as a journal or logbook.  A capture template automatically puts entries in it in the proper datetree hierarchy.

Then, use the variety of tools available to help you find what you need:

* https://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle
* Org Agenda commands, sparse trees, etc. (use the dispatcher, and see the manual)

Perhaps the best advice is to not get overwhelmed.  Org is huge, with a lot of built-in tools.  It's also a foundation for building your own tools that meet your needs.  Take your time, learn as you go, and over time your tools will become more powerful and useful.  Don't worry about getting everything just right before starting to use the system, because it just doesn't work that way (and that's a good thing, because if it did, it would mean that it was inflexible and limited).  And (theoretically, at least) you can always write some code to retrofit your earlier data into whatever new system you come up with.  :)

Have fun!

Ever had to fix your broken config in a bare bones Emacs? I adopted this from [abo-abo](https://github.com/abo-abo) and bound it to `C-x C-c`:

```elisp
(defun test-emacs ()
  "Test if emacs starts correctly."
  (interactive)
  (if (eq last-command this-command)
      (save-buffers-kill-terminal)
    (require 'async)
    (async-start
     (lambda () (shell-command-to-string
                 "emacs --batch --eval \"
(condition-case e
    (progn
      (load \\\"~/.emacs.d/init.el\\\")
      (message \\\"-OK-\\\"))
  (error
   (message \\\"ERROR!\\\")
   (signal (car e) (cdr e))))\""))
     `(lambda (output)
        (if (string-match "-OK-" output)
            (when ,(called-interactively-p 'any)
              (message "All is well"))
          (switch-to-buffer-other-window "*startup error*")
          (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
          (insert output)
          (search-backward "ERROR!"))))))

```
This makes sure I never exit when the config is broken, so I can fix it with my full featured Emacs setup. First `C-x C-c` will show if everything is right, second `C-x C-c` will exit.

I'm sure this was widely known, but wow-- 

So, I started seeing a "Vacuous Schema" message when loading a specific Org file, and couldn't figure out why. The message didn't give me much to go on, and the file is kind of huge, so going through possible solutions one at a time was slow and miserable.

I wished I could debug the message -- or turn on some sort of verbose mode or something. And that's when I discovered the `debug-on-message` variable. 

This variable lets you debug what happens to cause any message, using a regex to find the right message. 

So, in my simple case I just eval'd:

```elisp
(setq debug-on-message "vacuous schema")

```
And re-opened the file, and lo-and-behold, it told me exactly what I needed to know to fix the screwed up source block. 

It's just... awesome to be able to answer the age-old, "Huh, I wonder why it said that...?" situation so easily.

I do something similar. But for me a big epiphany was to realize all my organization files and all my wiki files should live in the same directory to allow for simple hyperlinks across them and a beautiful flat structure.

The only difference is that I don't version control some of my organization files. E.g. my tasks. But that's a .gitignore detail.

I prefer all my tasks to live inside a single org file, instead of letting my agenda view harvest them from multiple files. I keep a separate calendar file with fixed events and holidays.

A second epiphany was to realize the best way to manage my tasks is not the much hyped GTD, but a JIT approach: a kanban board. I've set up my agenda view to mimic a kanban. GTD has some nice ideas: keeping a few or ideally one inbox and differentiating between tasks, tasks with deadlines, tasks with scheduled times and events.

But it does have a big flaw, for my personal lifestyle and for many creative people. It doesn't control flow. It leads to creating way too many tasks, no prioritization, and task lists become outdated frequently. This requires a lot of wasteful updating.

In my case, I split my life into a few key areas, and I limit the number of ongoing tasks for each area. I've also gotten rid of GTD contexts. I'm content with states: TODO, PROG (progress), WAIT (blocked) and DONE.

Lastly, I do really believe organization systems are only half-baked if they don't integrate into a knowledge system. Why? Because some tasks are not actionable. They are just knowledge bits you want to store and reuse in the future. Here they explain it better than I do: https://praxis.fortelabs.co/gtd-x-pkm-8ff720ef6939/

I believe in keeping stuff simple. And learning from Japanese production systems, which got lots of things right and which we seem to be reinventing in bad ways.

After using Emacs for maybe 10 years I finally started using registers and I really should have started earlier. For those who don't know:

&#x200B;

* Highlight text and C-x r s <char> to save to register <char>
* C-x r i <char> to put the contents of the register at the cursor point. The text is still there -- use it over and over again

It seems like quite a few keystrokes but it's really not. Of course you can re-assign them to other keys if you don't like the defaults.

I see a bunch of people using the "old" functions for keyboard macros, but I find the "new" ones more convenient so I thought I'd  advertise them a bit here. I won't list all the things these functions do, so consult the help to get the full story.

The older functions are these:

- `kmacro-start-macro` (`C-x (`): starts recording.
- `kmacro-end-macro` (`C-x )`): stops recording, and with a numeric argument it will also run the macro that number of times (the recording counts as the first run).
- `kmacro-end-and-call-macro` (`C-x e`): executes the last keyboard macro; a positive numeric argument indicates the number of repetitions, an argument of zero runs until an error occurs.
- `kmacro-insert-counter` (`C-x C-k C-i`): each keyboard macro gets its own counter, this function inserts the current value of the counter and increments it by one.
- `kmacro-set-counter` (`C-x C-k C-c`): the macro counter start at zero, this command sets it to the numeric argument --useful to start numbering at 1, for example.

With those commands, for example you can produce:

```elisp
Hello, #1!
Hello, #2!
Hello, #3!
Hello, #4!
Hello, #5!

```
by typing `C-1 C-x C-k C-c C-x ( Hello, # C-x C-k C-i ! RET C-5 C-x )`.

OK, now for the good stuff: all of that functionality can be achieved using just these two newer functions:

- `kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter` (`<f3>`): start recording if used outside a macro, and if you pass a numeric argument when you start recording, it sets the initial value of the counter. When used while already recording, it will insert the counter and increment it by one. So this command subsumes  `kmacro-start-macro`,  `kmacro-insert-counter`, and  `kmacro-set-counter`.
- `kmacro-end-or-call-macro` (`<f4>`): stops recording, optionally running the macro as many times as indicated by the numeric argument. When used while _not_ recording, it just runs the last keyboard macro. So this command subsumes `kmacro-end-macro` and `kmacro-end-and-call-macro`.

The example given above becomes `C-1 <f3> Hello, # <f3> ! RET C-5 <f4>`, much smoother!

Not much of as trick, but something helped me as a newbie, which must be very obvious to many. When you want to see how to correctly configure a package or use a function in elisp, and when documentation is not helping you, go to GitHub and search like "use-package package-name", switch over to the code tab and change language to Emacs lisp. This will give you hundreds of examples.

`shortdoc` - one of the new things in Emacs 28.1 - is great for maintaining your own "cheat sheets" of Elisp functions as you discover them. For example, eval this in your Emacs session:

```elisp
(define-short-documentation-group my-datetime
  "Querying current time"
  (current-time
   :eval (current-time))
  (float-time
   :eval (float-time))
  
  "Time formats"
  (time-convert
   :eval (time-convert (current-time))
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'list)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 100000)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 200000)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) t)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'integer))
  
  (float-time
   :eval (float-time (current-time))))

```
After this, the `my-datetime` group will show as an option in `M-x shortdoc-display-group`. Additionally, if you view help for any of the functions mentioned above, the Help buffer will refer back to the `my-datetime` shortdoc group!

The example used here is a cheatsheet I just started writing for myself, as I've been researching the built-in time functions. For additional instructions on use, see `define-short-documentation-group` macro. For use examples, jump to the source of `define-short-documentation-group` and scroll down a bit - the default shortdoc groups are defined there.

I have two org mode link tips:

1. `(setq org-return-follows-link t)` lets you press RET to follow a
   link. Don't worry, the traditional behavior of RET, namely inserting
   a newline, is still easy: `C-q C-j`.

2. I often want to see what the destination of a link is. I used to
   use one of these methods:
   
   - mouse hover,
   - running and canceling `org-insert-link` (`C-c C-l`, read the
```elisp
 destination, `C-g`),
```
   - `org-toggle-link-display`, which toggles between the neat formatting of 
```elisp
 links and the raw source and is pretty ugly.
 
```
   But a better option is to use `display-local-help` (`C-h .`), which
   will show the tooltip in the echo area. And, you can even have the
   tooltip at point echoed automatically with `(setq
   help-at-pt-display-when-idle t)`. There is a delay controlled by
   the variable `help-at-pt-timer-delay` which I like to set to 0.
   Beware that just using `(setq help-at-pt-timer-delay 0)` has no effect,
   you need to use `customize-set-variable` or manually cancel the
   timer and set a new one (see below).
   
   Now, these `help-at-pt` variables aren't specifically for org
   links, they control the behavior of all tooltips, and I quickly
   realized I really only wanted to change the behavior in org mode
   buffers. You can do that as follows:
   
```elisp
   (defun echo-area-tooltips ()
     "Show tooltips in the echo area automatically for current buffer."
     (setq-local help-at-pt-display-when-idle t
                 help-at-pt-timer-delay 0)
     (help-at-pt-cancel-timer)
     (help-at-pt-set-timer))

   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'echo-area-tooltips)
```

Sometimes I want to get info about my IP address (e.g. if VPN is

This function uses `request` to display infos from `ipinfo.io`:

```elisp

  "Return ip info from ipinfo.io for IP."
  (interactive "sEnter IP to query (blank for own IP): ")
  (request
   (concat "https://ipinfo.io/" ip)
   :headers '(("User-Agent" . "Emacs ipinfo.io Client")
              ("Accept" . "application/json")
              ("Content-Type" . "application/json;charset=utf-8"))
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message
                (mapconcat
                 (lambda (e)
                   (format "%10s: %s" (capitalize (symbol-name (car e))) (cdr e)))
                 data "\n"))))

                         (message "Can't receive ipinfo. Error %S " error-thrown)))))

```
As I like to keep my own init.el clean with use-package
[here](https://github.com/dakra/ipinfo.el) is the same function
packaged.

A small basic thing, but once I'd discovered it, I started using dired.
```C-x C-j``` is most likely bound to ```dired-jump```, and this function opens dired for this window's file, without promting for directory (and this prompt was an issue for my workflow when using ```C-x d```). That makes finding and switching files just as convenient as in OS GUI. I've also bound a few keys when in dired mode (I find them decent):

```a``` - prompt a name and create empty file

```d``` - prompt a name and create empty dir

```u``` - go to parent dir (the key is a mnemonic to "go Up in directory tree)

```j``` - if it's a dir go into it, otherwise find this file (key is near to 'u' so jumping up and down is not a big deal with one hand, also the 'j' is the easiest key for me as a touchtyper) 

```n```/```p``` - move one entry down/up, which resembles ```C-n```/```C-p```

I learned something great today, thanks to [emacs.stackexchange.com](https://emacs.stackexchange.com) user `jue`.

Say, you want to grab a column of stuff from a buffer and put it in another buffer.

Emacs's `rectangle` commands seem perfect for such a thing.
The problem I've always had is not being able to insert the rectangle as new lines in the middle of some other buffer.

For example, say I have a `dired` buffer like this:

```elisp
  total used in directory 20 available 9223372036849890833
  drwxr-xr-x  14 colinf staff  448 Jun  9 16:47 .
  drwxr-xr-x 184 colinf staff 5888 Aug  2 08:52 ..
  drwxr-xr-x   3 colinf staff   96 Jun  9 16:47 .circleci
  drwxr-xr-x  14 colinf staff  448 Aug  5 22:15 .git
  -rw-r--r--   1 colinf staff  342 Jun  9 16:47 .gitignore

```
And I just want to grab the file sizes (`488`, `5888`, `96`, ‚Ä¶) and add those as new lines in the middle of some existing `org-mode` files.

```elisp
‚ãÆ
** Some heading
- I want to put those file sizes here.
** Some other heading
*** Other subhead
*** Another other subhead
‚ãÆ
```
I would always end up with something like
```elisp
‚ãÆ
** Some heading
 488
5888** Some other heading
  96*** Other subhead
 448*** Another other subhead
‚ãÆ
```
When what I wanted was
```elisp
‚ãÆ
** Some heading
 448
5888
  96
 448
 342 
** Some other heading
*** Other subhead
*** Another other subhead
‚ãÆ
```

Anyway, what I learned is to:
1. narrow the org buffer to just the current line (`narrow-to-region` usu. `C-x n n`)
2. yank that rectangle (`yank-rectangle` usu. `C-x r y`) into the narrowed buffer
3. undo the narrowing (`widen` usu. `C-x n w`)

It automatically opens up lines for the yanked rectangle.

[Maybe the rest of the Emacs-using world already knew this, but it has bugged me‚Äîvery slightly and very occasionally‚Äîfor 20+ Emacs-using years.]

Here's a really old trick that I only just now started using: save window layouts to registers with `C-x r w <Letter>`, which saves it into a `Letter` key register. Switch between window layouts using the usual "register jump" `C-x r j`, that is `C-x r j <Letter>` to go back to the layout in that lettered register.

If you use registers for storing text or other things, be careful to use a different set of letters for text and a different set for window layouts. Personally I never use registers for storing text (`M-y` to rotate through the kill-ring is all I need). But I have been using the window layout one quite often lately.

It feels a little like having the multiple desktops feature common to many Linux desktop environments, but I can use it to switch between different projects I am working on within Emacs without needing multiple instances of Emacs.

I'm slowly working on an alternative shell: [https://github.com/TatriX/tshell](https://github.com/TatriX/tshell)

Instead of using repl-like interface, all the commands go to one buffer (and file if you want) and output goes to another buffer. Like if you put your elisp code in \*scratch\* buffer and then evaluate it with \`C-x C-e\`.

It's in a very early stage, but it already allows me to solve most tasks I usually do with more traditional shells.

Let me know what is your first impression, what can be improved and what  do you think in general!

When you are in the middle of inputting some command in the minibuffer and realize you forgot to to invoke the command with prefix arg the following enables you to restart the minibuffer command with prefix arg when pressing C-u in minibuffer (keeping your input). Works for ivy commands, too:

```elisp
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(require 'ivy)
(defvar minibuffer-this-command+ nil
  "Command minibuffer started with.")

(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook
      (defun minibuffer-set-this-command+ ()
        (setq minibuffer-this-command+ real-this-command)))

(define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd "C-u") 'minibuffer-restart-with-prefix+)
(define-key ivy-minibuffer-map (kbd "C-u") 'minibuffer-restart-with-prefix+)
(defun minibuffer-restart-with-prefix+ ()
  "Restart current minibuffer/ivy command with prefix argument."
  (interactive)
  (let ((input (ivy--input)))
    (cond ((memq  #'ivy--queue-exhibit post-command-hook)
           (ivy-quit-and-run
             (let ((current-prefix-arg '(4))
                   (ivy-initial-inputs-alist `((,(ivy-state-caller ivy-last) . ,input))))
               (call-interactively (ivy-state-caller ivy-last)))))
          (t
           (ivy-quit-and-run
             (let ((current-prefix-arg '(4)))
               (minibuffer-with-setup-hook (lambda ()
                                             (insert input)
                                             (minibuffer-message "C-u"))
                 (call-interactively minibuffer-this-command+))))))))
```

### Highlighting

Adds a background color to matched text in the buffer. You can have multiple overlays each with a different background color. Some bindings:

```elisp
M-s h .         highlight-symbol-at-point
M-s h l         highlight-lines-matching-regexp
M-s h u         unhighlight-regexp
```

This is for the evil users out there: 

Usually evil text objects are powerful enough, but sometimes you can use the extra functionality that [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el) provides. So, sometime in the last month I started using it, and I managed to find a (quite seamless in my opinion) way to integrate it with evil. 
```elisp
  
(defhydra hydra-expand-region ()
   "region: "
   ("k" er/expand-region "expand")
   ("j" er/contract-region "contract"))

(evil-define-key 'visual 'global (kbd "v") #'hydra-expand-region/body)
 
```
The above code should be pretty self-explanatory to anyone familiar with evil and hydra. By pressing v in visual state you "enter" the expand region hydra that lets you call expand and contract region by pressing j/k, effectively creating an additional evil state with a minimal amount of code

Just one thing: which Spacemacs "style" did you choose? If you chose "vim" style you need to be careful when searching for emacs resources or documentation, because the "vim" style is quite different from the standard emacs way of doing things, and that's probably why you had so much problem in the beginning.

Meta advice: when taking notes, put the notes where you would go look for them.  If you're trying to find some notes, think about where you would try to look first.  If it's not there, remember where you looked and once you find the notes, make a link/copy to where you looked first.  The more you do this, the better you'll get at picking the right spot the first time.

Try to keep things as flat as possible.  Your job is not to present a theses about the perfect taxonomy for your notes, it's just to find things again later.  Don't make lots of folders, directories, scattered Org files, deeply nested lists, etc.  Only start breaking things into groups once you find yourself looking for something and thinking, "All of this X related stuff should just go into a folder or something."  This combines with the first advice in that if everything is flat, there aren't very many places you will want to look for something.  If you come up with a huge tree that would make a biologist cry, you'll have a really hard time remembering where exactly you put something.

This advice was shameless stolen/adapted from GTD.

`C-l` `(recenter-top-bottom)` is a known command that "recenters" the window around point by scrolling to the top, center, bottom.

But there's a no so well-known version, `C-M-l` `(reposition-window)`, that intelligently scrolls the buffer so that the function under point is fully visible, etc. It's very useful for programming languages modes.

For ages, I've had a custom function in my init that will add numbers to the front of a list -- transforming this:

```elisp
line 1
line 2
line 3

```
Into:

```elisp
1. line 1
2. line 2
3. line 3

```
But I just discovered this functionality is *built in*!

To just add numbers, select a region and call `rectangle-number-lines` with `C-x r N`. 

To customize things like what number to start at, or the format of the numbers (to add periods or parens after the numbers, for example) call it with the universal argument and it'll go through the options with you.

Truly, the batteries are included with Emacs.

Working in education, I often find myself having to assign students into groups. This week I made a function in ELisp that helps me do this. Select a region in a buffer that contains a list of students (presumably), call this function, say how many students should be in each group and the function then randomly assigns groups.

I use Emacs for React development and it's usually great (rjsx-mode). We recently introduced styled components into our app and while they're very handy, not having proper css support inside rjsx-mode was pretty annoying. I was looking for solutions, maybe extending rjsx-mode, but I wasn't up to that task. I then realized the built-in emacs commands and buffers themselves could solve my problem! What I want is for css inside a styled component, which always looks something like this:

```elisp
const myDiv = styled.div` // notice the backtick
    Some css...
 ` // ending backtick

```
to *actually* use scss-mode when editing, and then return to rjsx-mode when finished. The elisp is very simple and leads to a trivial workflow:

```elisp
;; The following 2 functions allow editing styled components with all scss mode features.
(defun edit-styled-component ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    (save-excursion
      (let ((start (search-backward "`"))
            (end (search-forward "`" nil nil 2))) ; second occurrence, since first is `start'
        (narrow-to-region start end)))
    (scss-mode)))

(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'rjsx-mode
  "ms" 'edit-styled-component)

;; When editing is done, use the same key sequence to return to the original file.
(defun return-from-styled-component ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    (widen)
    (rjsx-mode)))

(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'scss-mode
  "ms" 'return-from-styled-component)


```
So now when I edit a styled component I just hit **, m s**, which narrows the region to whatever is enclosed by backticks (i.e. all the css) and actually treats it as a bona fide css buffer, with all my snippets, completion, etc. Then when I'm done I just got **, m s** again to widen back to the original (rjsx) buffer!

```elisp
(defun eshell/history ()

```
It lets you use your normal completion framework to select an item from history. Suddenly fzf-like history!

It becomes hard to remember which version you noted an interesting tip you want to return to.

I don't know if it is generated by a script it should but it should be simple. It can be made more search engine friendy prefixing or suffixing with `r/emacs` if other subreddits do something similar.

If you're not using [`native-comp`](http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html) feature yet, I strongly recommend you to try it out! Have been using it for two weeks for now and everything seem to run pretty smooth and rock solid! The speed difference is quite noticeable in some interactive aspects like completion, although my machine is quite slow, so this may not be that noticeable on newer machines.

## Use chrome DOM for eww

Basically, a lot of websites these days generate the DOM using javascript. You can dump the DOM from chrome and inject it into eww just before it renders.

It's set to wait 3 seconds before dumping the DOM. This allows many pages to load.

Since I'm using the `unbuffer` program, this requires `expect` to be installed on your system. It creates a tty so that chrome doesn't crash when run in this way.

`dump-dom` shell script

```elisp
#!/bin/bash

url="$1"
test -n "$url" || exit 1

0</dev/tty unbuffer bash -c "chrome --headless --disable-gpu --virtual-time-budget=3000 --dump-dom \"$url\" 2>/dev/null"

```
Make these modifications to `eww-display-html`.

`eww-display-html`

```elisp
(defun eww-display-html (charset url &optional document point buffer encode)
  (unless (fboundp 'libxml-parse-html-region)
    (error "This function requires Emacs to be compiled with libxml2"))
  (unless (buffer-live-p buffer)
    (error "Buffer %s doesn't exist" buffer))
  ;; There should be a better way to abort loading images
  ;; asynchronously.
  (setq url-queue nil)
  ;; If document exists then the html is already parsed into a DOM
  (let* ((html (shell-command-to-string (concat "dom-dump " (shell-quote-argument url))))
         (document
          (or nil ;; document

`M-x quick-calc` (which I've bound to `C-=`).  Calc is insanely complex, but this lets you do simple calculations quickly.

I really love org mode. The way to use org mode in my opinion is to set up capture templates directing notes and tasks quickly to the right files (whichever you like).

http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html

You can then use the agenda to view, sort, filter, and search your notes and tasks. 

http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-commands.html

Once you get used to adding things quickly and finding them quickly it all falls into place. You can even export your notes in various formats including ICS (calendar) files so you can view your appointments on your phone.

One major advantage Evernote has is of course a Mobile app. I get around this by renting a very cheap vps and ssh'ing to it to use emacs (from my phone, my Chromebook, or workstation). I use the vps for other things, too.

The other is the images. I really don't know how to handle that. Org mode has ways to link to files and other things but I haven't tried displaying them or otherwise wiring working with images.

This works for me and I love using emacs for this purpose. I have tried a million other methods and this seems to work for me.

Here is a great tutorial: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html

You can store a bookmark on a Magit status window and it WORKS!

I just tried it last night figuring it would err when I tried to open the bookmark later, and it worked and I'm very excited about it.

This is the perfect entry point for projects for me, being reminded of what state source control is in. I used to jump to Dired in the .git root or some main code window but neither were helpful to start my day. This is perfect.

I set the bookmark with \`helm-filtered-bookmarks\` by just being on the Magit window and running that then typing in my name, and this is what was added to my bookmark file:

```elisp
("my magit bookmark title"
 (front-context-string . "Unstaged changes")
 (rear-context-string . "[redacted for reddit]\n\n")
 (position . 124)
 (handler . magit--handle-bookmark)
 (mode . magit-status-mode)
 (filename . "/redacted/path/to/.git")
 (magit-hidden-sections
  (stashes . "refs/stash")
  (unpushed . "@{upstream}..")))

```
I quit Emacs, made an edit in my .git elsewhere, opened Emacs back up and jumped to this bookmark and it showed me the change! 

It's funny how excited I am to remove two keystrokes from the beginning of my day. Probably I am also excited that my random experiment worked. Obviously it's not so random as magit knew exactly what I wanted. Magit is life! </rant>

I've read many blog posts touting the benefits of a literate emacs configuration. They say things about it making code easier to read and understand, and about being able to use org-mode itself to manipulate your code. But among the many benefits, I typically don't see much talk about programmatically exploiting the fact that your code is divided into executable sections based on some category. I also haven't seen many configurations exploit this either.

One exception is [noctuid's config](https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.emacs.d). He uses it to address the problem of [how to gracefully handle errors in your init file](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/669/how-to-gracefully-handle-errors-in-init-file).

This is not a new problem. In fact, this was mentioned by [clemera](https://www.reddit.com/user/clemera) in [the first trial of weekly tips and tricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/aja311/first_trial_of_a_weekly_emacs_tipstricksetc_thread/). There he suggested binding \`C-x C-c\` to a function that runs your \`init.el\` file in an external process and prevents you from quitting if there are any errors. Although this solution gets the job done and is certainly better than nothing, I was not too fond of it for a couple of reasons.

(1) It makes exiting emacs take a long time because just before exiting you're now loading your *entire* config to check if there are any errors. I like my commands to be snappy and quick.  (2) It happens when I'm exiting emacs. If I'm exiting emacs, it's likely for a good reason (I have something else I want to do). I don't in general like emacs preventing me from quitting it, unless it's just prompting me to save files. (3) You're almost forced to fix the problem right there and then. If you don't and you leave, your \`init.el\` file wont run next time you start emacs.

The way noctuid handled this is wrapping the code in his source blocks with \`with-demoted-errors\` with a [custom tangle function](https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/lisp/noct-util.el). The nice things about this method is you're not forced to fix the problem immediately: if there's an error in your config, it will just skip the error in the section, and run the rest of your config. This means that if you're pressed for time you can get whatever you wanted to get done and quit emacs without fear of not being able to start it up again. Also, it's efficient in the sense that you don't have to run your config two times (one time for setting up emacs and one time at the end to catch errors), it's all done at startup.

In this post I want to point out that what noctuid does is not something we need a literate config to do. I tried literate programming and I (as well as some [others](https://valignatev.com/posts/emacs-org-config/)) have emerged dissatisfied. The drawbacks of a literate configuration are many. Among the most notable are (1) the additional complexity from tangling (2) the annoyance of having to enter an elisp block every time you want to edit the code (3) the additional overhead of having to load org mode when opening your init file (4) *duality* \- having 2 files with the same information that need to be synced (the init elisp file and the init org file).

To achieve something like noctuid and still have an elisp init file, I am considering writing a macro \`elisp-block!\` which will function similarly to org-mode's \`#+BEGIN\_SRC\` syntax except for one key difference. Org source blocks do nothing on their own, they're just syntax markers for org mode whereas \`elisp-block!\` is also a *macro*. What this means is that the *vast majority of the code in our \`init.el\` file will be* *in a macro* (the only thing that can't be in the macro is the \`elisp-block!\` itself)*.* This give us an obscene amount of power.

There are many possibilities of what we can do with this, but I will give a taste:

```elisp
(defvar blacklisted-elisp-block-categories nil
  "Names of elisp blocks that will not be evaled")

(defvar init-file-errors nil "Errors during startup.")

(defmacro elisp-block! (name category &rest code)
  (declare (indent 2))
  `(unless (memq ,category blacklisted-elisp-block-categories)
     (condition-case init-error
         (progn ,@code)
       (error
        (push ,category blacklisted-elisp-block-categories)
        (push init-error init-file-errors)
        (message
         (format "%S in source block %S of category %S\n"
                 (car init-error)
                 ,name
                 ,category))))))

```
\`elisp-block!\` will catch any errors in CODE and print them out instead of raising them (and interrupting execution of your \`init.el\`). It will also tell you the specific block where that happened in the message and store the error in case you want to see what it was later. Finally, it will ensure that subsequent blocks of the same category are not run by adding their categories to \`blacklisted-elisp-blocks\`. In effect, this will ensure that any code that depends on a particular elisp block that has an error will not be run.

The main drawback to \`elisp-block!\` is that it will be littered throughout the \`init.el\`. Yet perhaps this is not so bad, I mean we do this with \`use-package\` as well. In any case, IMO the benefits outweigh the costs.

I just now figured out that you can interactively pass flags to commands like `counsel-rg` by putting the `--` separator between the flags and the search string, so something like `-g '*.txt' -- whatever` will search for `whatever` only in `txt` files. `counsel` uses a function called `counsel--split-command-args` to split the parts before and after the `--`.

I just discovered the [selected](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/selected.el) package, which is brilliant. It creates a keymap that becomes active any time you have an active region. I have bindings for next-line, previous-line, rectangle-mark-mode, end-of-line, upcase-dwim, exchange-point-and-mark, etc. It makes editing and acting on the active region super easy. Sort of like god-mode or Vim's visual mode.

I feel like a lot of us average Emacs users miss out on a lot of functionality Emacs provides outside of the box. So some things you might find interesting:

#### [Registers](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Registers.html)

Someone posted this in a weekly tips/trick/etc thread a few weeks ago, but I thought I'd mention it again.

Registers just let you store *things* in them. This can be

- Cursor positions in buffers (`C-x r SPC [name you want to give the register]`)
- Text in a region (`C-x r s [name you want to give the register]`)
- Rectangles (`C-x r r [name you want to give the register]`)
- State of windows in frames (`C-x r w [name you want to give the register]`)
- State of all frames and their windows (`C-x r f [name you want to give the register]`)
- Numbers (`C-x r n [name you want to give the register]`) and you can increment those numbers (`C-x r + [name of register you want to increment`]
- Whole file names (it's not bound, but you can do `M-: (set-register ?z '(file . "/some_file/somewhere/some_text.txt"))`)
- Keyboard macros instead of saving them (` C-x C-k x  [name you want to give the register]`)

You can insert text, registers, or numbers with `C-x r i [name of register with stuff to insert]`. You can also append or prepend stuff to registers with `append-to-register` or `prepend-to-register`.

`C-x r j [name of register]` can jump to a point, restore a window or frame configuration, or visit a file with a specific name.

You could always use [bookmarks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html#Bookmarks).

One thing I would like to do is automatically give registers names, say like a1, a2, et cetera then b1, b2 et cetera, and then A1, A2 and yaddah yaddah.

I'm an idiot though and generating that sort of collection escapes me a bit.

I'd rather not do just

```elisp
(loop n from 0 to 99
    collect (concat "a" n))

```
for every alphabetical character. Then it'd be a matter of going through those collections for every register created and making sure they use different names. Was wondering if I could get some help.

#### [Isearch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch) and [Query Replace](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Query-Replace.html)

Not much to say here, just that I might recommend that one go over the default keys for [isearch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch#toc2) and query-replace.

Also I would switch `C-s` and `C-r` to use `isearch-forward-regex` and `isearch-backward-regex`, and `M-%` to use `query-replace-regex` because you can disable the use of regex for both. You can even start a query-replace from isearch with `M-%` or `C-M-%`.

#### `event-apply-*` Keys

I don't really know what I can use these keys for, but with which-key you can press `C-x @` to see them. They allow you to apply control, shift, alt, meta, super, or hyper keys.

Not very well-known, but Emacs has its own spreadsheet and file format (`.ses`) (`ses-mode`). It supports many advanced features, and formulas are written in Elisp.

If you're using the default VIM mode keybindings, it sounds like you've really fallen for the VIM-style modal workflow.

Also, if you find Spacemacs slow (particularly at startup), try DOOM Emacs.

Bit of code to flip the window split from horizontal to vertical or vice versa.  Been in my .emacs almost since the beginning, so unfortunately I don't know where I got it from.  I use it when I switch emacs from half screen to full screen.

```elisp
;;flips two windows from horizontal split to vertical split
(defun rotate-windows ()
  (interactive)
  (if (= (count-windows) 2)
      (let* ((this-win-buffer (window-buffer))
             (next-win-buffer (window-buffer (next-window)))
             (this-win-edges (window-edges (selected-window)))
             (next-win-edges (window-edges (next-window)))
             (this-win-2nd (not (and (<= (car this-win-edges)
                                         (car next-win-edges))
                                     (<= (cadr this-win-edges)
                                         (cadr next-win-edges)))))
             (splitter
              (if (= (car this-win-edges)
                     (car (window-edges (next-window))))
                  'split-window-horizontally
                'split-window-vertically)))

I thought it might be a fun project to make a package to expose org-capture templates as endpoints, so I can add reminders to my TODO list via any device on the network. Turns out, it was easy enough that a package would be kinda pointless:

```elisp
(defservlet* capture/:keys/:contents text/plain () (org-capture-string contents keys))

```
Now I can hit "localhost:8080/capture/t/test reminder" and it'll put a "* TODO test reminder" line into my todo.org. Neat!

If you want to edit the commit that added/deleted a particular line of code, Magit offers `magit-edit-line-commit` that will do the interactive git rebase automatically for you.

`magit-diff-edit-hunk-commit` does the same but from a Magit diff buffer.

Very nice post!  Although I certainly do not deserve to be named in the company of such pillars of the community as Sacha, John, and Nicolas.

You should consider starting a "real" blog to host these more permanently (or more personally and visibly, at least).  I often find myself reading blog posts from a few years ago about Emacs/Org, but old Reddit posts like this are probably more likely to fade into obscurity.  Then you can write a blog post about blogging with Emacs/Org!  ;)  You could also then submit it to Planet Emacs for syndication.  Kaushal Modi has set up a beautiful blog with Org and Hugo, so you might use it as an example.

Thanks for sharing your insights!

Maybe you already know about `occur`, which shows matching lines in the current buffer -- like grep, but the buffer doesn't need to be backed by a file.

Emacs also has `multi-occur` which does the same thing across multiple buffers (you have to specify each one); and `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers`, which matches lines across buffers whose name matches a regexp'.

Most of the time, I want to search *all* open buffers, so I wrote:

```elisp
(defun multi-occur-global (regexp &optional nlines)
  "Do a `multi-occur' across all buffers."
  (interactive (occur-read-primary-args))
  (thread-first
```
  ;; Don't occur in *Occur* buffers
  (lambda (buffer) (eq (buffer-local-value 'major-mode buffer) 'occur-mode))
(cl-remove-if (buffer-list))
(multi-occur regexp)))
```elisp
```

This is great if you have IRC chats or emails open in Emacs and need to quickly find a previous conversation.  And of course `occur` works properly with `next-error` / `previous-error` just like the `grep` commands do.

Inspired by the venerable Twitch [Stay Healthy Bot](https://www.twitch.tv/stayhealthybot), I decided to do up a similar reminder feature from my local Emacs. It's more or less just a timer mixed with alert.el. There's still some work do be done here (mostly in regards to resetting the timer, as my usual workflow is to close out Emacs at the end of the workday), but I've found it pretty useful during the workday to keep me hydrated and moving around.

```elisp
(use-package alert
  :config
  ;; OS-dependent
  (setq alert-default-style 'osx-notifier)

  ;; Reminder to stay healthy!
  (defvar stay-healthy--start nil)
  (defvar stay-healthy--timer nil)
  (defun stay-healthy--alert (start-time)
    "Alert the user to stay healthy"
    (let* ((now (time-to-seconds (current-time)))
           (seconds (- now start-time))
           (hours (format-seconds "%h" seconds)))
      (unless (string= hours "0")
        (alert
         (format "You've been working for %s hour(s)! Have you been drinking your water? It might also be a good time to get up and stretch, refill your water, grab something to eat, or maybe take a bathroom break! Stay Healthy!"
                 hours)
         :title "Stay Healthy!"
         ))))

  (defun stay-healthy-start-timer ()
    "Start a timer to keep you healthy"
    (interactive)
    (unless stay-healthy--start
      (setq stay-healthy--start (time-to-seconds (current-time))))
    (setq stay-healthy--timer (run-with-timer 0 (* 60 60) #'stay-healthy--alert stay-healthy--start)))

I find `M-\` preferable to a separate `hungry-delete` package (i.e. do it if that's what you mean to do, but not otherwise).

or `M-SPC` to call `just-one-space` if that's what you mean to do.

or bind something to `cycle-spacing`.

In the spirit of `incf` this is an abstraction to toggle a truth value without having to write the place twice.

E.g. write `(togglef foo)` instead of `(setf foo (not foo))`.

```elisp
(defmacro togglef (place)
  "Toggle PLACE.  non-nil becomes nil, nil becomes t.
PLACE may be a symbol, or any generalized variable allowed by ‚Äòsetf‚Äô.
The return value is the new value of PLACE."
  `(setf ,place (not ,place)))

Most of the time when I need to basic calculations, `quick-calc` is enough, no need to fire up `calc`.

But sometimes it is nice to keep the expression as well, for modifying/copying the expression for further calculations.

Also, for example, when planning costs for a project it is nice to keep expressions and results with comments in an org file for future reference.

So I set up this basic function for calculating the expression written on the current line and then **insert the result on the next line**. Bound to <H-return> for easy access without conflicting with other modes.
Nothing fancy, and requires the expression to be on a single line. It can probably be improved a lot, but it does what I intended already.

That said, improvements and suggestions are very welcome, my current elisp skills mostly extends to copy and pasting online example code. :)


```elisp
(defun w0w-calculator ()
  "Calculate math expression on current line using calc-eval"
  (interactive)
  (setq cLine
      (buffer-substring-no-properties
       (line-beginning-position)
       (line-end-position)))
  (save-excursion
    (end-of-line)
    (open-line 1))
  (forward-line 1)
  (insert(calc-eval '("evalv($)" calc-internal-prec 18) 'num cLine)))

(global-set-key (kbd "<H-return>") 'w0w-calculator)    

```
Usage, on a single line, write some math, and then press `<H-return>`

```elisp
125*2+3^2 ;; press <H-return>
259       ;; answer given and inserted in buffer
```

I've used orgmode a lot, Evernote only a little. Orgmode works best when your notes are stored as "children" within a single large outline (or a small number of outlines, e.g. one per large topic). Storing hundreds of individual files doesn't work so well.

It is possible for orgmode to display images inline by default - there is a variable that controls that (org-startup-with-inline-images) or you can put this line in your orgmode file:

```elisp
#+STARTUP: inlineimages

```
You can apply multiple tags to items in orgmode files, although the tags are crowded onto the end of the item's headline so it can get cumbersome and ugly if an item has more than a handful of tags.

Adding notes can be done very efficiently in orgmode using the "capture" functionality. You can add notes based on different predefined templates by associating each template with a hotkey. You can even set up a bookmark in your web browser that will add highlighted text as a new orgmode note when you click it (see "org-protocol" in the manual).

The main problem with orgmode is that it is completely dependent on Emacs. Essentially no other program understands the orgmode format, beyond the fact that it is based on plain text. There is a mobile app ([MobileOrg](http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/)) but it seems to be seldom updated and I have not found it useful. There are also modules that attempt to integrate orgmode with [Toodledo](http://toodledoo.com) and [Trello](http://trello.com). However, if you rely on orgmode then you should be aware that it will be difficult for you to interact with your notes database when you are not sitting in front of a computer running Emacs.

For notes, I use [SimpleNote](http://simplenote.com) (free, available for most platforms + web client, syncs your notes, plain text but also allows tagging of notes). For task management, orgmode is the most powerful piece of software available -- no contest -- but because of its mobile-unfriendliness I have ended up using OmniFocus instead (Mac/iOS only).

Another alternative to consider is Microsoft OneNote, which is free and is available on a lot of platforms. I don't think MS will be disappearing any time soon.

I just started using mu4e and wanted to have some visual indication of which account was associated with each email. Did this quickly but it seems to work well. This is akin to what K9 mail does on android.

The names "account1" refer to the folders in your Maildir for each account, i.e., \~/Maildir/account1

&#x200B;

```elisp
(setq x-mu4e-account-colors '(("account1" . "orange")

  "Add a small color block to headers view indicating the account for each email"
  (let* ((maildir (nth 1 (s-split "/" (plist-get msg :maildir))))
         (color (cdr (assoc maildir x-mu4e-account-colors))))
    (setq line (concat x-mu4e-account-colors-prefix line))
    (put-text-property 0 (- (length x-mu4e-account-colors-prefix) 2) 'face `(:background ,color) line)
    line))

AucTeX

When you compile your TeX file and there are errors, the message asks you to see error messages using

```elisp
 C-c `

```
This leads to the last error which is sometimes incomprehensible and you are left to yourself to figure out what went wrong.

Instead of getting the last error, you can get an overview of all the errors by setting below variable to `t`:

```elisp
 (setq TeX-error-overview-open-after-TeX-run t)

```
You can pop this up in a separate frame using:

```elisp
  (setq TeX-error-overview-setup 'separate-frame)

```
Related docs are [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Error-overview.html).

This totally changes the way you can handle errors messages.

This is a classic "Wow, Emacs does that?" situation: I discovered `imenu` by accident this week.

On the one hand, it's a great tool for finding definitions in code -- but because my main use of Emacs is for writing and PIM, the thing that really excited me was `imenu-add-menubar-index`. 

In org files, it treats each heading as a part of the index -- so by adding `imenu` to the menu bar, I have fly-out navigation for large org files. (I know people hate the menu bar, but I've found it handy). 

That's all well and good, but now add in the `imenu-list`package, and you have a little pop-up outline of your org file just one keypress away: it's like the bookmarks in a PDF, and has been really helpful already in getting around. Light, clean, easy.

Customizing `org-imenu-depth` sets how deep into a nested hierarchy to index for either `imenu-list` or the menubar index.

This is one of the things that I'm sure exists somewhere but I can't find it so I wrote a few lines. I work in a big monorepo and depend on `projectile` for navigation by adding `.projectile` files here and there, in subdirectories that I consider "projects". However there are some directories that e.g. contain libraries. If I want to work on all of them for e.g. refactoring, going into a project then locks me in that (I mean `projectile-find-file`) and I have to manually go into another project. Also I flood my projectile cache with little things that I might not use a lot. What I did was add some logic to create temporary root directories for projects, where I can then use `counsel-file-jump` and `counsel-ag`. I have some keybindings and with a prefix argument I am prompted to change the temp root. Here's the code:
```elisp
(defvar my/temp-project-root nil)

(defun my/get-or-set-temp-root (reset)
  (let* ((reset-root (if reset my/temp-project-root nil))
```
     (root
      (if (or reset
              (null my/temp-project-root)
              (not (file-directory-p my/temp-project-root)))
          (read-directory-name "Temp root dir: " reset-root)
        my/temp-project-root)))
(setq my/temp-project-root root)))

```elisp
(defun my/counsel-file-jump-temp-root (reset)
  (interactive "P")
  (my/get-or-set-temp-root reset)
  (let ((current-prefix-arg nil))
```
(counsel-file-jump nil my/temp-project-root)))

```elisp
(defun my/counsel-ag-temp-root (reset)
  (interactive "P")
  (my/get-or-set-temp-root reset)
  (let ((current-prefix-arg nil))
```
(counsel-ag "" my/temp-project-root)))
```elisp
```
Also `counsel-file-jump` is so good

I just found out that the tables in `org-mode` support Excel-like calculations.  You can use functions from `calc` as well as arbitrary Elisp expressions!

Only complaint is that it's not the most performant. I tested it on a table of ~1200 rows and it took around 8 seconds to update my calculated column. :/

(define-minor-mode pair-programming-mode ()
  "Toggle Pair Programming Mode.

This prompts for a pair programmer from your current git commit history.
When you commit with (ma)git, the pair programmer is inserted as a co-author.
Additionally, line number mode is enabled."
  :global t
  :lighter " PP"
  (if pair-programming-mode
```
  (enable-pair-programming-mode)
(disable-pair-programming-mode)))

```elisp
(defun insert-pair-programmer-as-coauthor ()
  "Insert your pair programer into the current git commit."
  (when (and pair-programming-mode git-commit-mode)
```
(pcase pair-programming--pair-programmer
  (`(,name ,email) (git-commit-insert-header "Co-authed-by" name email))
  (_ (error "No pair programmer found or wrong content")))))

```elisp
(add-hook 'git-commit-setup-hook 'insert-pair-programmer-as-coauthor)

On a Mac: make Emacs detect if you have light or dark mode enabled system wide.

If you have two themes, a light one and a dark one, and you want the dark theme by default unless you have light mode enabled, add this to your init.el:

```elisp
;; If we're on a Mac and the file "~/bin/get_dark.osascript" exists
;; and it outputs "false", activate light mode. Otherwise activate
;; dark mode.
(cond ((and (file-exists-p "~/bin/get_dark.osascript")
            (string> (shell-command-to-string "command -v osascript") "")
            (equal "false\n"
                   (shell-command-to-string "osascript ~/bin/get_dark.osascript")))
       (mcj/theme-set-light))
      (t (mcj/theme-set-dark)))

```
(mcj/theme-set-light and mcj/theme-set-light are functions that enable the light and the dark theme, respectively).

~/bin/get_dark.osascript contains the following:

```elisp
tell application "System Events"
	tell appearance preferences
		get dark mode
	end tell
end tell

I sometimes clone stuff with https instead of ssh, so this fixes that:

```elisp
(defun isamert/git-origin-switch-to-ssh ()
  (interactive)
  (when-let* ((https-origin (s-trim (shell-command-to-string "git config --get remote.origin.url")))
              (it (s-match "https://\\(.*\\)\\.\\(com\\|net\\|org\\)/\\(.*\\)" https-origin))
              (ssh-origin (format "git@%s.%s:%s" (nth 1 it) (nth 2 it) (nth 3 it))))
    (shell-command-to-string (format "git remote set-url origin %s" ssh-origin))))


```
It works for github/gitlab etc. You need to extend the regexp for making it work for more obscure addresses.

If you:

1. Develop code on remote machine;
2. Use SSH to access remote; and
3. Annoyed by `flycheck` not working properly over TRAMP

Then consider using [`sshfs`](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) to mount your remote filesystem to local. This way, `flycheck` will regard your files just as a local one, and works properly. Neat trick discovered today when debugging flycheck-flake8 with my colleague (are you reading? :P)

This week I learned that:

-	You can redefine all yes/no prompts to y/n:
`(defalias ‚Äòyes-or-no-p ‚Äòy-or-n-p)`

-	`C-c C-c` in LaTeX-mode buffers will allow you to compile/view output (I‚Äôve used LaTeX-preview-pane for the last couple of years)

-	Tab-stops in yas-snippet are very handy for filling out multiple parts of a template, didn‚Äôt even know these existed:

I've been using `M-|` (`shell-command-on-region`) frequently for years, and I only just stumbled on the fact that the region need not be active to use it.  If it isn't, the command operates on the text from point to the end of the buffer.  That's very reasonable and in line with various other commands, but the documentation doesn't mention it and so I never thought to try it.

That saves me a call to `C-x h` (`mark-whole-buffer`) whenever I want to process the entire buffer, which is most of the time.  Also, it's a minor distraction for the entire buffer to be highlighted when I'm composing my shell command, so it's nice to avoid that.

Edited to add:  Sorry folks, this doesn't work like I thought it did.  See the coments below for details.

Not sure if it will be helpful to anyone else - but working on legacy code, I often need to review code in large files with hundreds of errors and warnings. So I wrote a package which runs Flycheck on all the files in a diff and filters the output to only the lines which was modified or added! https://github.com/ragone/magit-diff-flycheck. I hope you like it - it‚Äôs currently in review to get published on MELPA.

Idea: this thread could also double as a "help me implement this" thread.

Speaking of that: Is it possible to get atom-like completion suggestions before you start typing? I'm doing some CSS, and in Atom when you write something like

```elisp
.exampleclass {
    text-align: <cursor here>
}

```
Atom would give autocomplete-suggestions, displaying a list of possible values like "center", "left", "right". Company doesn't seem to do this.

Simple, but I think it counts as a tip: [minions](https://github.com/tarsius/minions) by [u/tarsius_](https://www.reddit.com/user/tarsius_). It allows one to invert the usual logic of managing minor modes lighters in the mode-line. While the default behaviour is "show everything by default, unless you diminish/delight it", `minions` goes in the opposite direction and hides all of them, unless you explicitly tell it to show them. Besides, the minor modes are still available, alongside some other common ones which thus become more easily accessible, in a menu which aggregates minor modes in the mode-line. Pretty neat.

If I have a file that I'd like to live in a Git repo, but I don't want to have to bother telling Git to ignore it, I'll just create it elsewhere but then put a line at the top like:

```elisp
# -*- default-directory: "/path/to/repo/"; -*-

```
The file then lives in the repo for nearly all intents and purposes, despite being stored elsewhere.  For example, if I run a shell command while visiting the file, the shell is run in the repo directory; Projectile commands can be run in the repo while visiting the file; etc.  Very handy!

Just a cool concept: if you have a keypad on your keyboard which you rarely use, bind its nums to something useful. The results are numlock-sensitive and are NOT the same keycodes as regular numbers, so they're just free keys. For example, `(define-key map (kbd "<kp-1>") 'winum-select-window-1)`

This is something I'm not actively using anymore, but it was one of my I-love-emacs moments, so I wanted to share this for a while.

At work, I used to have an org-mode journal where I would take meeting notes. After the meeting, I exported the subtree for the current meeting to a PDF (via ODT) and sent it to the participants via mail.

After a while I extended org-export to get a shortcut (`C-e C-s o M`) to automatically

* export to PDF via ODT
   * using a proper corporate design & logo via ODT\_STYLES\_FILE header
* rename the file to include the current date
* open thunderbird, starting a new message with
   * subject taken from document title (if exporting all) or subtree heading (if exporting subtree
   * pre-filled text
   * the exported PDF already attached

Moving, marking & killing by paragraph.

I've been using these for a while as a customisation of Xah-Fly-Keys, but I was surprised to learn that many Emacs users don't know this functionality.

I find that moving by paragraph is a good middle ground between moving vertically by line and moving vertically by page, it's a very natural hierarchy.

I move the page to display the correct section of the buffer, then I move to the right paragraph, then to the right line within that paragraph.

The default bindings for movement are annoying, `M-{`/`M-}`, but it's simple enough to rebind them to `M-[`/`M-]`.

You can mark the current paragraph with `M-h`.

When I have multiple buffers opened and I switch from another program to emacs I always get confused about which buffer the cursor is in. So I created a mapping to

I guess if no one has learned yet, you can create external shell scripts for Emacs with having just

```elisp
!#/usr/bin/env bash
":"; exec emacs --script "$0" -- "$@"

```
At the top of a script and any elisp code you write under that will be ran when you run the script.

I don't know many fancier things to do with it than that. Some people probably know more.

To log in to Slack I need a client ID, a client secret, and a token.  I don't want to store them in my `.emacs` file, since I share that publicly.  I looked at authinfo, but that seems to just map names to single passwords.  So what I do is, I put those three items in a Lisp property-list in a file `~/.slack-credentials` that only I can read:

```elisp
(:client-id "my-id"
 :client-secret "my-secret"
 :token "my-token")

```
Then in my `~/.emacs` I do this:

```elisp
(use-package slack
  ;; ... stuff omitted ...
  :config
  (let ((credentials (with-temp-buffer
                       (insert-file-contents-literally "~/.slack-credentials")

Prettify the minibuffer prompt on the default value

```elisp

(minibuffer-electric-default-mode)

```
Then try eval

```elisp
(read-string "Year (default 2019): " nil nil "2019")

```
You will notice "Year (default 2019): " is shorten to "Year [2019]: ", and when
you enter anything, the prompt is shorten further to "Year: ". Next time, you
use the minibuffer api, if you provide the default value, don't forget to format
the prompt using that specfic format.

The `git grep` git command is great for finding a regex (or a simple string) everywhere in a git repo. I define the following functions and bind the `git-grep` function to `F2`. It will prompt for a regex and search for that in the repo or, if you give it a numeric prefix like `C-u` it will read the current symbol at point (the word under the cursor) and search for that. Results appear in a grep buffer, so you can use `C-g C-n` and `C-g C-p` to navigate from one result to the next.

```elisp
(defun git-root-dir ()
  "Returns the current directory's root Git repo directory, or
NIL if the current directory is not in a Git repo."
  (let ((dir (locate-dominating-file default-directory ".git")))
    (when dir
      (file-name-directory dir))))

(defun git-grep (arg)
  "Runs 'git grep', starting the search in the current
directory's root git repo directory.

By default, reads the regex from the minibuffer. With a prefix
argument, initializes the search string with the current symbol
at point."
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((symbol-at-point (thing-at-point 'symbol))
         (regexp (if (and arg (symbol-at-point))
                   (regexp-quote symbol-at-point)
                     (read-from-minibuffer
                      "Search regexp: " nil nil nil 'grep-find-history)))

         (default-directory (git-root-dir))
         (case-ignore-flag (and (isearch-no-upper-case-p regexp t) "-i"))
         (cmd (concat "git grep --extended-regexp --line-number --full-name"
                      " --untracked " case-ignore-flag " -- \"" regexp "\""
                      " | cut -c -240")))
    (while (equal "" regexp)
        (setq regexp (read-from-minibuffer
                      "Search regexp (must not be the empty string): " nil nil nil 'grep-find-history)))
    (grep-find cmd)))
```

I started to append a custom suffix to my personal package customizations instead of using a prefix. For example instead of `clemera-org-occur` I would use `org-occur-clemera`. This way I use the same elisp "namespace" as the package with my own custom "sub namespace", which has some advantages for completions, searches and so on.

Use the header line to show the mode line's information:

```elisp
(setq-default header-line-format mode-line-format
              mode-line-format nil)

```
Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/cejaNar.png

This doesn't work everywhere e.g., some major modes need manipulate the header line for their own use.

I had previously written a function to replace org-beginning-of-line to behave this way, but later found `org-special-ctrl-a/e` which does exactly what I wanted for C-a (and C-e). The default behavior drove me crazy and I didn't know there was a built-in fix. 

```elisp
 "Non-nil means `C-a' and `C-e' behave specially in headlines and items. When t, `C-a' will bring back the cursor to the beginning of the headline text, i.e. after the stars and after a possible TODO keyword.  In an item, this will be the position after bullet and check-box, if any.  When the cursor is already at that position,another `C-a' will bring it to the beginning of the line.`C-e' will jump to the end of the headline, ignoring the presence of tags in the headline.  A second `C-e' will then jump to the true end of the line, after any tags.  This also means that, when this variable is non-nil, `C-e' also will never jump beyond the end of the heading of a folded section, i.e. not after the ellipses.When set to the symbol `reversed', the first `C-a' or `C-e' works normally, going to the true line boundary first.  Only a directly following, identical keypress will bring the cursor to the special positions.This may also be a cons cell where the behavior for `C-a' and`C-e' is set separately.

I use `mu4e` as email client. I guess that it is common to send some email to later discover that you forgot the attachment.

This routines check if a mail **likely** needs an attachment by matching a simple regexp. If this is the case and there is no attach, we are asked to confirm that this is what we want to do.

```elisp
  ;;
  ;; Auto-detect if there is a missing attachment in the
  ;; mail and warn before sending.
  ;;
  ;; See https://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2018/026414.html

  most cases this just matches a few keywords"

    "Count number of attach keywords in buffer and return t 
  if there is any"

      (let (
            (res (count-matches message-likely-needs-attach-regex)))

  (defun mail-number-of-attach ()

    (interactive)
    (save-excursion

I'm sure that this is something that people already knew about, but I had no idea until today.

I often start selecting text and realise that I actually want a rectangular selection (or the other way round). 

I found out that rather than having to jump to the mark, cancel, and restart, I can just press `C-x SPC` `[xfk: SPC r SPC]` `(rectangle-mark-mode)` and Emacs will toggle to the other selection scheme.

```elisp

  :diminish
  :config
  .
  .
  .
  (setq company-global-modes '(not eshell-mode shell-mode))

works as intended

`rx` isn't just an (extensible!) sexp syntax for regexps, it's an optimizing compiler!

Examples:

-   `(rx (or "dude@home.org" "dude@work.com"))` produces
```elisp
`"\\(?:dude@\\(?:home\\.org\\|work\\.com\\)\\)"`
```
-   `(rx (intersection (any (?g . ?z)) (any (?a . ?p))))` produces  `"[g-p]"`

And from Lisp code it's easy to plug in computed portions, using `eval`.
For example I recently used this in some silly code to count mentions
of animals in the bible :P:

```elisp
(defun plural (word)
  (pcase word
    ("mouse" "mice")
    ("wolf" "wolves")
    ("fish" "fishes")
    (word (concat word "s"))))

(defun bible-count (word)
  "Count number of times WORD or its plural appears in the bible."
  (with-current-buffer "king-james-bible.txt"
    (count-matches
      (rx-to-string `(word-start (or ,word ,(plural word)) word-end)))))

```
Which I used to make an Org mode table with an Emacs Lisp column formula:

```elisp
#+TBLFM: $2='(bible-count $1)

```
**EDIT**:  A previous version of the `bible-count` function used the `rx` macro and the `eval` construct:

```elisp
(defun bible-count (word)
  "Count number of times WORD or its plural appears in the bible."
  (with-current-buffer "king-james-bible.txt"
    (count-matches (rx word-start
                       (or (eval word) (eval (plural word)))
                       word-end))))

```
This version is incorrect: `eval` is meant to be used only for value known at compile time. It's actual [behavior is very complicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g5bat3/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/fo7qdas) and depends on plenty of seemingly extraneous circumstances.

```
The context is that I occasionally use Spark throughout the day, but having a Spark shell open keeps a substantial amount of resources reserved, and my co-workers and I are encouraged to close our shells when not using them.  This way, I don't have to bother remembering.

function e --description 'Edit in Emacs'
    if [ "$INSIDE_EMACS" = "vterm" ]
        printf '\e]51;E%s\e\\' "find-file $argv"
    else
       emacsclient -c -a '' $argv &
    end
end

```
Basically, if I am already inside Emacs (Fish shell in a Vterm), `e filename` will open a file for editing in a window split next to my Vterm. If I'm not in Emacs (separate terminal), it will instead run `emacsclient` to edit the file in a new Emacs frame.

Setting up **org-mode LaTeX export configuration** will be much easier, if you include a `*.tex` file with your settings. like so:

```elisp
(setq org-latex-classes '(("mydocclass"
                           "\\input{my-org-template.tex}"                ;; <---- HERE --
                           ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                           ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                           ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                           ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                           ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}"))))

```
The `my-org-template.tex` has to be located where LaTeX can find it. (i.e in directory `$HOME/texmf/tex/`)

Content of the file can be all things you normaly have to define before the `\begin{document}` statement in a tex document.

Creating a nice LaTeX export theme that way, is much more convenient, debugable and robust.

I hope to see some cool org-LaTeX-export themes popping up. Imagine custom headers and footers with logos and stuff. ;)

I use Emacs on my laptop either undocked, either with external screens connected. It used to be manual work of dragging and resizing frames around, and then setting up windows, but no more, thanks to the great [dispwatch](https://github.com/mnp/dispwatch) package, which handles the screen changes after Emacs has been started. I [wrote some code](https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/emacs/setup.el#L154) for the initial frame setup, and now have this, which makes the docking/undocking fully seamless:

```elisp

Some things here might be overkill (cl-defstruct, seq?), but this was also an Emacs lisp exercise.

I think it's neat you can make use of Awk scripts with org-babel.

With learning Assembly, I used it to grab all the system calls from `/usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h`

```elisp
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gawk '{$1=" "; print substr($2, 6, $NF) " " $3}' /usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h
#+END_SRC

```
Granted the output isn't really fancy, but it works.

I recently discovered [button-lock.el](https://github.com/rolandwalker/button-lock/blob/master/button-lock.el) and the `rx` macro. These two have been great fun as I've been able to create all kinds of useful buttons.

For example, I am a lawyer and do a lot of legal writing in emacs. I use these for case and statute citations, e.g., if I input a case citation in the form of `/smith v. jones/, 156 F.3d 65 (11th Cir. 1999)`, I have a flexible/robust RX that button-lock uses to automatically open the case citation in a web browser in Westlaw when clicked. Same with statutes (e.g., `42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983`).

If you call `occur` with a numeric prefix argument it provides lines of context around each match: if the number is positive it provides that many lines before and after each match, if it is negative, it provides that many lines before each match (in absolute value).

And if you call `occur` with the universal prefix argument, `C-u`, it does something slightly different: it prompts you for a regexp as usual, but instead of collecting entire lines containing matches for the regexp, it collects either matches of the regexp (if it contains no captures), or it prompts you for a replace-like string to format each regexp match (where you can use the capture groups).

For example, I can easily get a list of the packages I configure in my init file with:

```elisp
C-u M-s o (use-package \(\S-+\) RET \1 RET

```
The `\1` is even there by default, so really only `RET` is needed in this case.

**EDIT**: I previously had the regexp `(use-package \(\<.*?\>\)`, which as u/Bodertz pointed out, doesn't do what I want.

> Remember window configuration (2:3)

Heya so window configuration, what exactly do you want? Do you want it so when you quit emacs and start it up it saves your session? If so `(desktop-save-mode 1)` might be what you're after [(info)](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html).

Are you doing something in emacs and some how the windows got messed up? To quickly revert add (winner-mode 1) to your init.el file and using the custom key binds C-c <left key> you can revert the window to the previous state [(info)](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode).

> - Open help and/or other files at a bottom buffer

To specify a buffer for help/other files, one way is by "locking" buffers. So I use this code to lock and unlock a buffer and then in your case I would set up one more buffer so that everything will open there.

```elisp
 (defun toggle-window-dedicated ()
        "Toggle whether the current active window is dedicated or not. 
 Code founded by peterfoldi 
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29332242/is-there-a-way-to-fix-window-buffer-in-emacs-for-cider-error-repl/33082302#33082302"
   (interactive)
   (message 
    (if (let (window (get-buffer-window (current-buffer)))
      (set-window-dedicated-p window 
                      (not (window-dedicated-p window))))
        "Window '%s' is dedicated"
      "Window '%s' is normal")
    (current-buffer)))

```
The help/pop up are annoying, and I think a hard problem to get right. 

> Make emacs place the auto-save files somewhere els

To make emacs stop doing #files# or files~ I use a piece of code provided by [Jorgen Sch√§fer](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/33/put-all-backups-into-one-backup-folder). Something to note #files# are autosave files as in files in which a copy that you haven't saved yet (so if emacs crashes your work can be recovered). If you save your file these will go away naturally. While files~ are actual backup files.

`bs-show` is an interesting command, it shows a pop-up-like buffer that you can use to quickly act on open buffers. There are a ton of customizations you can make and a bunch of convenient bindings. I've been trying it out instead of `list-buffers` and `ibuffer` and I like it so far, very fast.

Found / c for M-x ibuffer.  It filters buffers by content.
It looks like  'grep -c' .   Very helpful to locate a file quickly for which you remember any word from content

If you want executions of keyboard macros to undo in a single step, you can use the `undo-amalgamate-change-group` function that was added in Emacs 26.1:

```elisp
(defun block-undo (fn &rest args)
  (let ((marker (prepare-change-group)))
    (unwind-protect (apply fn args)
      (undo-amalgamate-change-group marker))))

(dolist (fn '(kmacro-call-macro kmacro-exec-ring-item))
  (advice-add fn :around #'block-undo))

```
And, of course, you can add that advice to other ready made functions you'd like to be able to undo in a single step. (I haven't found any examples in stock Emacs other than keyboard macros, where I want that behavior and don't already have it, but who knows). For new commands you write, it is probably best to use `undo-amalgamate-change-group` in the implementation rather than advising.

I posted this in the emacsclient thread, but I think it deserves to live here as well:


The emacsclient / server system is great.  If you have it listening on tcp and port forward that when connecting to remote machine it adds another level of power.

I use [emacs-vterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) for a terminal inside emacs, so I've got a lot of commands remapped.  Like `man` runs `emacsclient ... man ..`, which opens the man page in the "other" buffer, so it doesn't interrupt my flow.  I use "scroll-other-window" to navigate the man page while I still have my prompt. `magit`, `dired`, and others map to their `emacsclient` equivalents.

I've written wrapper script for e/emacs client that I've come to call `e`, because it saves keystrokes

#### [The full repo is here e-emacs.sh](https://gitlab.com/zackallison/e-emacs/)

It does the standard things you would expect, starts emacs if it's not already started, open a file in a new buffer / window / terminal and optionally wait for you to finish or have the shell continue.

Then I added some functions that I found useful, starting with piping results from a command into an emacs buffer, such as `find . -name foo\* | e`.  Naturally after that was piping from a buffer to a command: `e [file] | rot13` super secure encryption.  And of course piping into and out of a buffer works as well `find . -name incriminating-evidence\* | e | xargs rm`, so you can verify / tweak the results before passing them through.  Maybe you want to leave the evidence on Two Time Tommy.  Who knows.

The other nice feature is the ability to use templates.  For example to edit a HTTP request and then send it to a server you can do that: `e -t header_template.txt | nc www.example.com 80`  The template file is copied to a temp file which is the one that is edited.

Or the poor man's blog system: `e -t header_template.html body_template.html footer.html > new_page.html`

See the repo for more examples and to download.  The notes of getting it working on remote machines aren't the cleanest.  If you have any suggestions or features that would make your life easier let me know; submit an issue or comment here.

~~I really should post this on one of the share your stuff posts.  But I get distracted.~~ There, I did it.

In case you can't tell I *really* like emacs and it's client server model.

A colleague just showed me Intellij's "[compare with clipboard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/comparing-files-and-folders.html#clipboard)" feature: it's fairly neat, you select a region, invoke compare-with-clipboard and get a diff of the two selections.

It didn't take me long to implement something similar:

```elisp
(defun ediff-compare-region-clipboard (begin end)
  (interactive "r")
  (save-excursion
    (let ((selected-region (buffer-substring begin end))
          (clipboard-buffer (get-buffer-create "*ediff-clipboard*"))
          (region-buffer (get-buffer-create "*ediff-region*")))
      (with-current-buffer clipboard-buffer
        (insert (car kill-ring)))
      (with-current-buffer region-buffer
        (insert selected-region))
      (ediff-buffers clipboard-buffer region-buffer))))

```
It's not ideal though.  In particular, is there a better way to insert the "clipboard"?  One thing I quickly found was that you might copy the region to compare but then so many editing commands will add to the kill-ring, so I might want to make that part of the process interactive.
