I just discovered calc mode. Oh my ...
It does symbolic differentiation, solves linear equations, plots with gnuplot, and does matrix operations, all with a few key strokes!! How is this amazing tool not as popular as org mode or Magit?? I am so excited to explore it more, especially for the "display" options. I can see it taking my latex experience to the next level. 
Any tips on using calc mode?

I often use the compile feature to compile and run my projects to see the results in the compilation buffer. This works well unless you are waiting for user input in your terminal. I recently found out that you can invoke the compile with an additional non nil value to start compilation in comint-mode which allows for user input! 
The drawback is, that you then no longer can press q to close the window or g to recompile. Because of that I added a simple lambda, that switches to compilation-mode to the compilation-finish-functions. So I can give input while compiling and running, and after compilation I can close the window as usual with q.

There are basically two paradigms you can use with Org:

1.  Flat files.  Every heading is a top-level heading.  Use tags, properties, etc. on each one.
2.  Hierarchy.  e.g. datetrees, or manually organized trees.  Tags and properties can apply to entire subtrees.

The issue, as you know, is that cataloging data is time-consuming (just ask a librarian, I guess).  It's easy to spend more time organizing data than inputting or reading it.

So I recommend a hybrid, so to speak.  

*  Use manual hierarchies where it makes sense for you.  e.g. I have a reference file that I put information I want to keep long-term, with hierarchies like Computers/Software/Emacs/Tips.
*  Use flat files where it makes sense.  I have an inbox.org file that's just a long list of top-level headings (that I will supposedly refile to their proper location someday, but mostly I just search the file).
*  Use datetrees where it makes sense.  I have a log.org file that acts as a journal or logbook.  A capture template automatically puts entries in it in the proper datetree hierarchy.

Then, use the variety of tools available to help you find what you need:

* https://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle
* Org Agenda commands, sparse trees, etc. (use the dispatcher, and see the manual)

Perhaps the best advice is to not get overwhelmed.  Org is huge, with a lot of built-in tools.  It's also a foundation for building your own tools that meet your needs.  Take your time, learn as you go, and over time your tools will become more powerful and useful.  Don't worry about getting everything just right before starting to use the system, because it just doesn't work that way (and that's a good thing, because if it did, it would mean that it was inflexible and limited).  And (theoretically, at least) you can always write some code to retrofit your earlier data into whatever new system you come up with.  :)

Have fun!

back-to-indentation. Before I found this function I would always do some awkward triple key combo like C-a M-f M-b.

It's just bound to M-m. Jumps you right to the first non-white space character on the line. What's even spicier is that it works in reverse too - if you're at the front of the line it jumps you forward, if you're at the end or middle it jumps backward.

It still works even on lines that aren't indented, same as C-a in that case.

So useful, especially for resetting point during macros that need to start at the first char on the line.

Ever had to fix your broken config in a bare bones Emacs? I adopted this from [abo-abo](https://github.com/abo-abo) and bound it to `C-x C-c`:

```elisp
(defun test-emacs ()
  "Test if emacs starts correctly."
  (interactive)
  (if (eq last-command this-command)
      (save-buffers-kill-terminal)
    (require 'async)
    (async-start
     (lambda () (shell-command-to-string
                 "emacs --batch --eval \"
(condition-case e
    (progn
      (load \\\"~/.emacs.d/init.el\\\")
      (message \\\"-OK-\\\"))
  (error
   (message \\\"ERROR!\\\")
   (signal (car e) (cdr e))))\""))
     `(lambda (output)
        (if (string-match "-OK-" output)
            (when ,(called-interactively-p 'any)
              (message "All is well"))
          (switch-to-buffer-other-window "*startup error*")
          (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
          (insert output)
          (search-backward "ERROR!"))))))

```
This makes sure I never exit when the config is broken, so I can fix it with my full featured Emacs setup. First `C-x C-c` will show if everything is right, second `C-x C-c` will exit.

After using Emacs for maybe 10 years I finally started using registers and I really should have started earlier. For those who don't know:

&#x200B;

* Highlight text and C-x r s <char> to save to register <char>
* C-x r i <char> to put the contents of the register at the cursor point. The text is still there -- use it over and over again

It seems like quite a few keystrokes but it's really not. Of course you can re-assign them to other keys if you don't like the defaults.

`shortdoc` - one of the new things in Emacs 28.1 - is great for maintaining your own "cheat sheets" of Elisp functions as you discover them. For example, eval this in your Emacs session:

```elisp
(define-short-documentation-group my-datetime
  "Querying current time"
  (current-time
   :eval (current-time))
  (float-time
   :eval (float-time))
  
  "Time formats"
  (time-convert
   :eval (time-convert (current-time))
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'list)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 100000)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 200000)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) t)
   :eval (time-convert (current-time) 'integer))
  
  (float-time
   :eval (float-time (current-time))))

```
After this, the `my-datetime` group will show as an option in `M-x shortdoc-display-group`. Additionally, if you view help for any of the functions mentioned above, the Help buffer will refer back to the `my-datetime` shortdoc group!

The example used here is a cheatsheet I just started writing for myself, as I've been researching the built-in time functions. For additional instructions on use, see `define-short-documentation-group` macro. For use examples, jump to the source of `define-short-documentation-group` and scroll down a bit - the default shortdoc groups are defined there.

I'm sure this was widely known, but wow-- 

So, I started seeing a "Vacuous Schema" message when loading a specific Org file, and couldn't figure out why. The message didn't give me much to go on, and the file is kind of huge, so going through possible solutions one at a time was slow and miserable.

I wished I could debug the message -- or turn on some sort of verbose mode or something. And that's when I discovered the `debug-on-message` variable. 

This variable lets you debug what happens to cause any message, using a regex to find the right message. 

So, in my simple case I just eval'd:

```elisp
(setq debug-on-message "vacuous schema")

```
And re-opened the file, and lo-and-behold, it told me exactly what I needed to know to fix the screwed up source block. 

It's just... awesome to be able to answer the age-old, "Huh, I wonder why it said that...?" situation so easily.

I do something similar. But for me a big epiphany was to realize all my organization files and all my wiki files should live in the same directory to allow for simple hyperlinks across them and a beautiful flat structure.

The only difference is that I don't version control some of my organization files. E.g. my tasks. But that's a .gitignore detail.

I prefer all my tasks to live inside a single org file, instead of letting my agenda view harvest them from multiple files. I keep a separate calendar file with fixed events and holidays.

A second epiphany was to realize the best way to manage my tasks is not the much hyped GTD, but a JIT approach: a kanban board. I've set up my agenda view to mimic a kanban. GTD has some nice ideas: keeping a few or ideally one inbox and differentiating between tasks, tasks with deadlines, tasks with scheduled times and events.

But it does have a big flaw, for my personal lifestyle and for many creative people. It doesn't control flow. It leads to creating way too many tasks, no prioritization, and task lists become outdated frequently. This requires a lot of wasteful updating.

In my case, I split my life into a few key areas, and I limit the number of ongoing tasks for each area. I've also gotten rid of GTD contexts. I'm content with states: TODO, PROG (progress), WAIT (blocked) and DONE.

Lastly, I do really believe organization systems are only half-baked if they don't integrate into a knowledge system. Why? Because some tasks are not actionable. They are just knowledge bits you want to store and reuse in the future. Here they explain it better than I do: https://praxis.fortelabs.co/gtd-x-pkm-8ff720ef6939/

I believe in keeping stuff simple. And learning from Japanese production systems, which got lots of things right and which we seem to be reinventing in bad ways.

I see a bunch of people using the "old" functions for keyboard macros, but I find the "new" ones more convenient so I thought I'd  advertise them a bit here. I won't list all the things these functions do, so consult the help to get the full story.

The older functions are these:

- `kmacro-start-macro` (`C-x (`): starts recording.
- `kmacro-end-macro` (`C-x )`): stops recording, and with a numeric argument it will also run the macro that number of times (the recording counts as the first run).
- `kmacro-end-and-call-macro` (`C-x e`): executes the last keyboard macro; a positive numeric argument indicates the number of repetitions, an argument of zero runs until an error occurs.
- `kmacro-insert-counter` (`C-x C-k C-i`): each keyboard macro gets its own counter, this function inserts the current value of the counter and increments it by one.
- `kmacro-set-counter` (`C-x C-k C-c`): the macro counter start at zero, this command sets it to the numeric argument --useful to start numbering at 1, for example.

With those commands, for example you can produce:

```elisp
Hello, #1!
Hello, #2!
Hello, #3!
Hello, #4!
Hello, #5!

```
by typing `C-1 C-x C-k C-c C-x ( Hello, # C-x C-k C-i ! RET C-5 C-x )`.

OK, now for the good stuff: all of that functionality can be achieved using just these two newer functions:

- `kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter` (`<f3>`): start recording if used outside a macro, and if you pass a numeric argument when you start recording, it sets the initial value of the counter. When used while already recording, it will insert the counter and increment it by one. So this command subsumes  `kmacro-start-macro`,  `kmacro-insert-counter`, and  `kmacro-set-counter`.
- `kmacro-end-or-call-macro` (`<f4>`): stops recording, optionally running the macro as many times as indicated by the numeric argument. When used while _not_ recording, it just runs the last keyboard macro. So this command subsumes `kmacro-end-macro` and `kmacro-end-and-call-macro`.

The example given above becomes `C-1 <f3> Hello, # <f3> ! RET C-5 <f4>`, much smoother!

Just figured this out, maybe a bit of a hack...

In flyspell, I was annoyed I had to use mouse-2 when I wanted to correct a word, and I didn't want to sacrifice a major-mode keybinding to do it from the keyboard. But flyspell actually creates an overlay for misspelled words and attaches a keymap to it, which you can do I just realized- very cool. So I just bound `flyspell-correct-at-point` to "<return>" in the `flyspell-mouse-map`, and now return corrects words when my cursor is on a misspelled word!

But the fact you can attach keymaps to overlays just seems so useful, will definitely use in the future.

Not much of as trick, but something helped me as a newbie, which must be very obvious to many. When you want to see how to correctly configure a package or use a function in elisp, and when documentation is not helping you, go to GitHub and search like "use-package package-name", switch over to the code tab and change language to Emacs lisp. This will give you hundreds of examples.

I have two org mode link tips:

1. `(setq org-return-follows-link t)` lets you press RET to follow a
   link. Don't worry, the traditional behavior of RET, namely inserting
   a newline, is still easy: `C-q C-j`.

2. I often want to see what the destination of a link is. I used to
   use one of these methods:
   
   - mouse hover,
   - running and canceling `org-insert-link` (`C-c C-l`, read the
```elisp
 destination, `C-g`),
```
   - `org-toggle-link-display`, which toggles between the neat formatting of 
```elisp
 links and the raw source and is pretty ugly.
 
```
   But a better option is to use `display-local-help` (`C-h .`), which
   will show the tooltip in the echo area. And, you can even have the
   tooltip at point echoed automatically with `(setq
   help-at-pt-display-when-idle t)`. There is a delay controlled by
   the variable `help-at-pt-timer-delay` which I like to set to 0.
   Beware that just using `(setq help-at-pt-timer-delay 0)` has no effect,
   you need to use `customize-set-variable` or manually cancel the
   timer and set a new one (see below).
   
   Now, these `help-at-pt` variables aren't specifically for org
   links, they control the behavior of all tooltips, and I quickly
   realized I really only wanted to change the behavior in org mode
   buffers. You can do that as follows:
   
```elisp
   (defun echo-area-tooltips ()
     "Show tooltips in the echo area automatically for current buffer."
     (setq-local help-at-pt-display-when-idle t
                 help-at-pt-timer-delay 0)
     (help-at-pt-cancel-timer)
     (help-at-pt-set-timer))

   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'echo-area-tooltips)

If you're like me, and your day ends way past midnight, handling those last few tasks in your Org Mode agenda gets tricky. Fortunately, it turns out Org Mode has what I call "25th hour mode".

```elisp
;; consider the current day to end at 3AM
(setq org-extend-today-until 3) 

;; make timestamp processing functions aware of this
(setq org-use-effective-time t) 

```
Combined, this allows to extend the day past midnight, with things like agenda views, scheduling commands, repeaters, etc. thinking the current time is 23:59 up until the `org-extend-today-until` limit. With this enabled, if I have a task that has a repeater of  and complete it at 01:00, I no longer have to then manually reschedule the task back one day.

Just one thing: which Spacemacs "style" did you choose? If you chose "vim" style you need to be careful when searching for emacs resources or documentation, because the "vim" style is quite different from the standard emacs way of doing things, and that's probably why you had so much problem in the beginning.

If you needed more reasons to love Magit I've just found out can add the Git meta-fields in the commit message (`Co-authored-by`, `Signed-off-by`, etc, which I can never remember correctly) by typing `C-c TAB` which will interactively ask you for the field (`C-a` -> `Co-authored-by`) and then also interactively fill the relevant team member with their name and e-mail (probably from the repo's list of committers). Awesome!

I recently discovered `thing-at-point-looking-at`, which seems much easier to use on its own than to fully define a new kind of "thing."

For a while I've been wanting to conveniently identify a Jira ticket identifier at point so I can browse to it.  Ticket IDs are basically a sequence of letters, a hyphen, and a sequence of digits.  First I tried using `symbol-at-point`, but that can include extraneous neighboring characters, like `/` when the ticket ID is part of a URL.  Eventually, while poring over the `thingatpt` source, I found `thing-at-point-looking-at`, which quickly led to:

```elisp
(defun browse-ticket-at-point ()
  (interactive)
  (if (thing-at-point-looking-at (rx (+ alpha) "-" (+ digit)))
      (browse-url (format "https://jirahost/browse/%s" (match-string 0)))
    (error "No ticket at point")))

```
Easy peasy!

Meta advice: when taking notes, put the notes where you would go look for them.  If you're trying to find some notes, think about where you would try to look first.  If it's not there, remember where you looked and once you find the notes, make a link/copy to where you looked first.  The more you do this, the better you'll get at picking the right spot the first time.

Try to keep things as flat as possible.  Your job is not to present a theses about the perfect taxonomy for your notes, it's just to find things again later.  Don't make lots of folders, directories, scattered Org files, deeply nested lists, etc.  Only start breaking things into groups once you find yourself looking for something and thinking, "All of this X related stuff should just go into a folder or something."  This combines with the first advice in that if everything is flat, there aren't very many places you will want to look for something.  If you come up with a huge tree that would make a biologist cry, you'll have a really hard time remembering where exactly you put something.

This advice was shameless stolen/adapted from GTD.

I really love org mode. The way to use org mode in my opinion is to set up capture templates directing notes and tasks quickly to the right files (whichever you like).

http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html

You can then use the agenda to view, sort, filter, and search your notes and tasks. 

http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-commands.html

Once you get used to adding things quickly and finding them quickly it all falls into place. You can even export your notes in various formats including ICS (calendar) files so you can view your appointments on your phone.

One major advantage Evernote has is of course a Mobile app. I get around this by renting a very cheap vps and ssh'ing to it to use emacs (from my phone, my Chromebook, or workstation). I use the vps for other things, too.

The other is the images. I really don't know how to handle that. Org mode has ways to link to files and other things but I haven't tried displaying them or otherwise wiring working with images.

This works for me and I love using emacs for this purpose. I have tried a million other methods and this seems to work for me.

Here is a great tutorial: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html

For ages, I've had a custom function in my init that will add numbers to the front of a list -- transforming this:

```elisp
line 1
line 2
line 3

```
Into:

```elisp
1. line 1
2. line 2
3. line 3

```
But I just discovered this functionality is *built in*!

To just add numbers, select a region and call `rectangle-number-lines` with `C-x r N`. 

To customize things like what number to start at, or the format of the numbers (to add periods or parens after the numbers, for example) call it with the universal argument and it'll go through the options with you.

Truly, the batteries are included with Emacs.

I'm slowly working on an alternative shell: [https://github.com/TatriX/tshell](https://github.com/TatriX/tshell)

Instead of using repl-like interface, all the commands go to one buffer (and file if you want) and output goes to another buffer. Like if you put your elisp code in \*scratch\* buffer and then evaluate it with \`C-x C-e\`.

It's in a very early stage, but it already allows me to solve most tasks I usually do with more traditional shells.

Let me know what is your first impression, what can be improved and what  do you think in general!

Here's a really old trick that I only just now started using: save window layouts to registers with `C-x r w <Letter>`, which saves it into a `Letter` key register. Switch between window layouts using the usual "register jump" `C-x r j`, that is `C-x r j <Letter>` to go back to the layout in that lettered register.

If you use registers for storing text or other things, be careful to use a different set of letters for text and a different set for window layouts. Personally I never use registers for storing text (`M-y` to rotate through the kill-ring is all I need). But I have been using the window layout one quite often lately.

It feels a little like having the multiple desktops feature common to many Linux desktop environments, but I can use it to switch between different projects I am working on within Emacs without needing multiple instances of Emacs.

I was reading through the org manual, and learnt about two variables `org-agenda-category-icon-alist` and `org-agenda-prefix-format`, the first allows you to set icons for categories (`CATEGORY` property), icons can be images or symbols, this is the code I came up with and the agenda already looks more colorful and clear


```elisp
(setq org-agenda-category-icon-alist nil)
(setq agenda-categories-alist
'(("WORK" "üíº") ("SOFTWARE" "üíª") ("SETUP" "üêß") ("EMAIL" "‚úâÔ∏è")
("HOME" "üè†") ("WOOD" "ü™µ") ("FAMILY" "üë™") ("REPORTS" "üìö")
("INCOME" "üí∞")))
(dolist (icon agenda-categories-alist) (add-to-list 'org-agenda-category-icon-alist
`(,(car icon) ,(cdr icon) nil nil :width (16.) :ascent center)))
(defun format-agenda-prefix () (interactive)
(setcar org-agenda-prefix-format '(agenda . "  %-2i  %?-12t% s")))
(add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook 'format-agenda-prefix)

```
Of course for the emojis to show up correctly I use this:

```elisp
(set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'symbol (font-spec :family "Noto Color Emoji"))

```
I am sure a lot of you know about these, please share your customization

Turns out you can open a single buffer in two windows side-by-side in a continuous view with `follow-mode`. That is, if your left buffer is showing lines 1-63, the right buffer will be showing you lines 64-126 and they will scroll together as well. There have been many times in the past where I wished my screen was a bit taller and Emacs will now let me do that :)

A very simple thing I've done is remap ";" (semicolon) to to "\_" (underscore) in almost all modes. Since I work with mainly Python, this is so much easier than always doing SHIFT-DASH every couple of keystrokes. And if I want a regular semicolon, I just do "C-u ;" and insert a semicolon

I also set this in modes such as C/C++, etc. This works by automatically setting the last character (if it was an underscore) to a semicolon on enter. 

eg. "|" is cursor

int a = 10\*10\_|

turns into

int a = 10\*10;

| (cursor on new line)

Working on a remote server with Tramp in eshell it's so easy that I'm always worried that I could run by mistake a command on the wrong machine.

So I implemented a small function that makes me aware that I'm in a Tramp session by changing the prompt color.

```elisp
(require 'subr-x)  
(defun tuxo/prompt-color-tramp ()  
"Change prompt color if a tramp session is open"  
  (if (file-remote-p default-directory)  
      (set-face-foreground 'eshell-prompt "red")  
      (set-face-foreground 'eshell-prompt "green")))

(use-package eshell
  :hook (eshell-post-command . tuxo/prompt-color-tramp))

```
Do you have any suggestions on how I could improve this issue?

If you want to search and replace but with preview for the matches, don't use `query-replace-regexp` directly. Instead start by searching for your regexp in `isearch-forward-regexp`, which highlights the matches interactively, and once you have the correct regexp, run `isearch-query-replace` (bound to `M-%` in `isearch-mode-map`).

Note that there is also an `isearch-query-replace-regexp` command but you don't need it: `isearch-query-replace` will automatically detect if your isearch session was for regexps. The docstring for `isearch-query-replace` doesn't seem to mention this nice feature.

This is for the evil users out there: 

Usually evil text objects are powerful enough, but sometimes you can use the extra functionality that [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el) provides. So, sometime in the last month I started using it, and I managed to find a (quite seamless in my opinion) way to integrate it with evil. 
```elisp
  
(defhydra hydra-expand-region ()
   "region: "
   ("k" er/expand-region "expand")
   ("j" er/contract-region "contract"))

(evil-define-key 'visual 'global (kbd "v") #'hydra-expand-region/body)
 
```
The above code should be pretty self-explanatory to anyone familiar with evil and hydra. By pressing v in visual state you "enter" the expand region hydra that lets you call expand and contract region by pressing j/k, effectively creating an additional evil state with a minimal amount of code

A small basic thing, but once I'd discovered it, I started using dired.
```C-x C-j``` is most likely bound to ```dired-jump```, and this function opens dired for this window's file, without promting for directory (and this prompt was an issue for my workflow when using ```C-x d```). That makes finding and switching files just as convenient as in OS GUI. I've also bound a few keys when in dired mode (I find them decent):

```a``` - prompt a name and create empty file

```d``` - prompt a name and create empty dir

```u``` - go to parent dir (the key is a mnemonic to "go Up in directory tree)

```j``` - if it's a dir go into it, otherwise find this file (key is near to 'u' so jumping up and down is not a big deal with one hand, also the 'j' is the easiest key for me as a touchtyper) 

```n```/```p``` - move one entry down/up, which resembles ```C-n```/```C-p```

## Use chrome DOM for eww

Basically, a lot of websites these days generate the DOM using javascript. You can dump the DOM from chrome and inject it into eww just before it renders.

It's set to wait 3 seconds before dumping the DOM. This allows many pages to load.

Since I'm using the `unbuffer` program, this requires `expect` to be installed on your system. It creates a tty so that chrome doesn't crash when run in this way.

`dump-dom` shell script

```elisp
#!/bin/bash

url="$1"
test -n "$url" || exit 1

0</dev/tty unbuffer bash -c "chrome --headless --disable-gpu --virtual-time-budget=3000 --dump-dom \"$url\" 2>/dev/null"

```
Make these modifications to `eww-display-html`.

`eww-display-html`

```elisp
(defun eww-display-html (charset url &optional document point buffer encode)
  (unless (fboundp 'libxml-parse-html-region)
    (error "This function requires Emacs to be compiled with libxml2"))
  (unless (buffer-live-p buffer)
    (error "Buffer %s doesn't exist" buffer))
  ;; There should be a better way to abort loading images
  ;; asynchronously.
  (setq url-queue nil)
  ;; If document exists then the html is already parsed into a DOM
  (let* ((html (shell-command-to-string (concat "dom-dump " (shell-quote-argument url))))

I learned something great today, thanks to [emacs.stackexchange.com](https://emacs.stackexchange.com) user `jue`.

Say, you want to grab a column of stuff from a buffer and put it in another buffer.

Emacs's `rectangle` commands seem perfect for such a thing.
The problem I've always had is not being able to insert the rectangle as new lines in the middle of some other buffer.

For example, say I have a `dired` buffer like this:

```elisp
  total used in directory 20 available 9223372036849890833
  drwxr-xr-x  14 colinf staff  448 Jun  9 16:47 .
  drwxr-xr-x 184 colinf staff 5888 Aug  2 08:52 ..
  drwxr-xr-x   3 colinf staff   96 Jun  9 16:47 .circleci
  drwxr-xr-x  14 colinf staff  448 Aug  5 22:15 .git
  -rw-r--r--   1 colinf staff  342 Jun  9 16:47 .gitignore

```
And I just want to grab the file sizes (`488`, `5888`, `96`, ‚Ä¶) and add those as new lines in the middle of some existing `org-mode` files.

```elisp
‚ãÆ
** Some heading
- I want to put those file sizes here.
** Some other heading
*** Other subhead
*** Another other subhead
‚ãÆ
```
I would always end up with something like
```elisp
‚ãÆ
** Some heading
 488
5888** Some other heading
  96*** Other subhead
 448*** Another other subhead
‚ãÆ
```
When what I wanted was
```elisp
‚ãÆ
** Some heading
 448
5888
  96
 448
 342 
** Some other heading
*** Other subhead
*** Another other subhead
‚ãÆ
```

Anyway, what I learned is to:
1. narrow the org buffer to just the current line (`narrow-to-region` usu. `C-x n n`)
2. yank that rectangle (`yank-rectangle` usu. `C-x r y`) into the narrowed buffer
3. undo the narrowing (`widen` usu. `C-x n w`)

It automatically opens up lines for the yanked rectangle.

[Maybe the rest of the Emacs-using world already knew this, but it has bugged me‚Äîvery slightly and very occasionally‚Äîfor 20+ Emacs-using years.]

When you are in the middle of inputting some command in the minibuffer and realize you forgot to to invoke the command with prefix arg the following enables you to restart the minibuffer command with prefix arg when pressing C-u in minibuffer (keeping your input). Works for ivy commands, too:

```elisp

  "Command minibuffer started with.")

(define-key ivy-minibuffer-map (kbd "C-u") 'minibuffer-restart-with-prefix+)
(defun minibuffer-restart-with-prefix+ ()
  "Restart current minibuffer/ivy command with prefix argument."

           (ivy-quit-and-run

          (t

Something amazin that I have been using recently is `ripgrep-all` as the `consult-ripgrep` command to search in pdfs. 

It is amazing with the `orderless` dispatchers to control the search filtering.
I use `!` to exclude a string and `=` to match exactly.

Also amazing with `embark-collect` which allows collapsing features.
Or within the collect buffer use `consult-line` to further filter.
And even open the pdf.

For me, learning about `kill-whole-line` (control-shift-delete) was a revelation.  Compared to the "classic" Emacs method of deleting lines (C-a to go to the beginning of the line if not already there, C-k once to kill to the end of line, C-k again to kill the newline), it feels like a major speedup.

I still use C-k frequently, but it's effectively just a kill-to-end-of-line command.

I'm trying to feminize my voice and org mode has been invaluable.

```elisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-lanuages
  '((shell . t)))

(setq org-capture-templates
  `(("v" "Voice" entry
    (file+olp+datetree ,(concat my-org-directory "voice/training.org"))
    ,(concat
      "* Record \n"
      "\n"
      "  #+begin_src sh\n"
      "    rec %(format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S\").aiff\n"
      "  #+end\_src\n"
      "\n"
      "* Play\n"
      "  #+begin_src sh\n"

      "  #+end_src\n")
    :immediate-finish t
    :jump-to-captured t)))

```
This requires 'SoX' for linux. You can go into the record src block and press \`C-c C-c\` to start recording and \`C-g\` to end. To play back the recording, press \`C-c C-c\` within the play src block. I imagine this might be useful beyond the trans community for basic voice journaling.

I thought perhaps I was completely out of the loop, not knowing what on earth MightEMacs is, but after google searching and reading around, seeing almost zero hits about it, so I don't think it's just me.

Therefore, it would be worth including an explanation of exactly what it is, (some sort of Emacs-lite?), how it differs from Gnu Emacs, and most importantly, why it exists.

I use Emacs for React development and it's usually great (rjsx-mode). We recently introduced styled components into our app and while they're very handy, not having proper css support inside rjsx-mode was pretty annoying. I was looking for solutions, maybe extending rjsx-mode, but I wasn't up to that task. I then realized the built-in emacs commands and buffers themselves could solve my problem! What I want is for css inside a styled component, which always looks something like this:

```elisp
const myDiv = styled.div` // notice the backtick
    Some css...
 ` // ending backtick

```
to *actually* use scss-mode when editing, and then return to rjsx-mode when finished. The elisp is very simple and leads to a trivial workflow:

```elisp
;; The following 2 functions allow editing styled components with all scss mode features.
(defun edit-styled-component ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    (save-excursion
      (let ((start (search-backward "`"))
            (end (search-forward "`" nil nil 2))) ; second occurrence, since first is `start'
        (narrow-to-region start end)))
    (scss-mode)))

(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'rjsx-mode
  "ms" 'edit-styled-component)

;; When editing is done, use the same key sequence to return to the original file.
(defun return-from-styled-component ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
    (widen)
    (rjsx-mode)))

(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'scss-mode
  "ms" 'return-from-styled-component)


```
So now when I edit a styled component I just hit **, m s**, which narrows the region to whatever is enclosed by backticks (i.e. all the css) and actually treats it as a bona fide css buffer, with all my snippets, completion, etc. Then when I'm done I just got **, m s** again to widen back to the original (rjsx) buffer!

You can store a bookmark on a Magit status window and it WORKS!

I just tried it last night figuring it would err when I tried to open the bookmark later, and it worked and I'm very excited about it.

This is the perfect entry point for projects for me, being reminded of what state source control is in. I used to jump to Dired in the .git root or some main code window but neither were helpful to start my day. This is perfect.

I set the bookmark with \`helm-filtered-bookmarks\` by just being on the Magit window and running that then typing in my name, and this is what was added to my bookmark file:

```elisp
("my magit bookmark title"
 (front-context-string . "Unstaged changes")
 (rear-context-string . "[redacted for reddit]\n\n")
 (position . 124)
 (handler . magit--handle-bookmark)
 (mode . magit-status-mode)
 (filename . "/redacted/path/to/.git")
 (magit-hidden-sections
  (stashes . "refs/stash")
  (unpushed . "@{upstream}..")))

```
I quit Emacs, made an edit in my .git elsewhere, opened Emacs back up and jumped to this bookmark and it showed me the change! 

It's funny how excited I am to remove two keystrokes from the beginning of my day. Probably I am also excited that my random experiment worked. Obviously it's not so random as magit knew exactly what I wanted. Magit is life! </rant>

I feel like a lot of us average Emacs users miss out on a lot of functionality Emacs provides outside of the box. So some things you might find interesting:

#### [Registers](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Registers.html)

Someone posted this in a weekly tips/trick/etc thread a few weeks ago, but I thought I'd mention it again.

Registers just let you store *things* in them. This can be

- Cursor positions in buffers (`C-x r SPC [name you want to give the register]`)
- Text in a region (`C-x r s [name you want to give the register]`)
- Rectangles (`C-x r r [name you want to give the register]`)
- State of windows in frames (`C-x r w [name you want to give the register]`)
- State of all frames and their windows (`C-x r f [name you want to give the register]`)
- Numbers (`C-x r n [name you want to give the register]`) and you can increment those numbers (`C-x r + [name of register you want to increment`]
- Whole file names (it's not bound, but you can do `M-: (set-register ?z '(file . "/some_file/somewhere/some_text.txt"))`)
- Keyboard macros instead of saving them (` C-x C-k x  [name you want to give the register]`)

You can insert text, registers, or numbers with `C-x r i [name of register with stuff to insert]`. You can also append or prepend stuff to registers with `append-to-register` or `prepend-to-register`.

`C-x r j [name of register]` can jump to a point, restore a window or frame configuration, or visit a file with a specific name.

You could always use [bookmarks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html#Bookmarks).

One thing I would like to do is automatically give registers names, say like a1, a2, et cetera then b1, b2 et cetera, and then A1, A2 and yaddah yaddah.

I'm an idiot though and generating that sort of collection escapes me a bit.

I'd rather not do just

```elisp
(loop n from 0 to 99
    collect (concat "a" n))

```
for every alphabetical character. Then it'd be a matter of going through those collections for every register created and making sure they use different names. Was wondering if I could get some help.

#### [Isearch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch) and [Query Replace](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Query-Replace.html)

Not much to say here, just that I might recommend that one go over the default keys for [isearch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch#toc2) and query-replace.

Also I would switch `C-s` and `C-r` to use `isearch-forward-regex` and `isearch-backward-regex`, and `M-%` to use `query-replace-regex` because you can disable the use of regex for both. You can even start a query-replace from isearch with `M-%` or `C-M-%`.

#### `event-apply-*` Keys

I don't really know what I can use these keys for, but with which-key you can press `C-x @` to see them. They allow you to apply control, shift, alt, meta, super, or hyper keys.

I just discovered the [selected](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/selected.el) package, which is brilliant. It creates a keymap that becomes active any time you have an active region. I have bindings for next-line, previous-line, rectangle-mark-mode, end-of-line, upcase-dwim, exchange-point-and-mark, etc. It makes editing and acting on the active region super easy. Sort of like god-mode or Vim's visual mode.

M-s h u         unhighlight-regexp

In preparation for the inclusion of eglot into Emacs core I've switched away from lsp-mode. As a result I've also switched from flycheck and to flymake. One nice thing about flycheck is that it allowed for stacking checkers. When coding Python I liked to stack flake8 for styles and mypy for types (plus the LSP's since it's already there).

Flymake allows for stacking checkers but it turns out eglot clobbers these checkers when "adding" the LSP's checker. To get stacked Flymake checkers with Eglot you can simply add them back after Eglot has done it's thing.

For example, here is a simple setup for Python which includes Pyright's type checking and flake8 style checking

```elisp
;; Use flake8 as the python style checker by default
(setq python-flymake-command '("flake8" "-"))

(use-package eglot
  :hook ((python-mode . eglot-ensure)
         (eglot-managed-mode
	  . (lambda ()
	      ;; re-enable flymake checkers because eglot clobbers
	      ;; them when starting
	      (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode)
		(add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions 
                          'python-flymake nil t)))))

  :custom
  ;; shutdown server after killing last managed buffer
  (eglot-autoshutdown t)
  :bind
  (("C-c l r" . eglot-rename))
  :config
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               `(python-mode "pyright-langserver" "-w" "--stdio")))

```
Now all that's left is mypy. Flymake originally used a ["Proc"](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/flymake.html#The-legacy-Proc-backend) method for creating checkers which existing mypy ones use. So for a bonus tip & trick [I've written a mypy checker in the new style](http://github.com/com4/flymake-mypy). It can be enabled when using eglot like this:

```elisp
(use-package flymake-mypy
  :straight (flymake-mypy
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "com4/flymake-mypy")
  :hook ((eglot-managed-mode . (lambda ()
				 (when (derived-mode-p 'python-mode)
				   (flymake-mypy-enable))))))

```
After opening a Python buffer and executing `M-x flymake-running-backends` we are greeted with a list of stacked checkers: `Running backends: eglot-flymake-backend, flymake-mypy--run, python-flymake`.

Small thing, but `C-x C-k C-f` runs `kmacro-set-format`, which you can use to change the format of the counter when they are inserted in a macro.

For example, `%x` for hexadecimal, or `%02d` to prefix the number with a zero if it is less than two digits.  The default is `%d`.

If you set it while recording a macro, it will only use the format in that macro.  If you set it outside of a macro, it will change the default for subsequent macros.

Making your own hooks using advice. So a hook doesn't exist where you'd like to be hooking into? You can use advice to create a hook.

```elisp
(defvar eww-restore-history-after-hook '())
(defun eww-restore-history-after-advice (&rest args)
  (run-hooks 'eww-restore-history-after-hook))
(advice-add 'eww-restore-history :after 'eww-restore-history-after-advice)
(add-hook 'eww-restore-history-after-hook (lambda ()
                                        (interactive)

Any **BibTeX** users here?

- Tired of journals forcing you to download a file to get the BibTeX record of an article?
- Tired of their usually broken formatting?
- The journal doesn't offer BibTeX download in the first place? (Looking at you Nature)

Did you know that doi.org has query interface that gives you the BibTeX record when you call it with the article DOI?  Of course you can access this via Emacs:

```elisp
(require 'url)
(defun user/url-bibtex-from-doi (doi)
  (interactive "sDOI: ")
  (let* ((url (concat "https://doi.org/" doi))
         (url-mime-accept-string "application/x-bibtex"))
    (insert
     (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously url)
       (let* ((start url-http-end-of-headers)
              (end (point-max))
              (all (buffer-string))
              (body (buffer-substring start end)))
         (replace-regexp-in-string "^\t" "  " (url-unhex-string body)))))))

```
Just paste the DOI of the article at the prompt and the BibTeX record will be inserted at point.

Here is how I bind it in `bibtex-mode` (plus my other bindings for good measure)
```elisp

;; bibtex
(use-package bibtex
  :bind (:map bibtex-mode-map
              ("C-c d" . user/url-bibtex-from-doi)
              ("C-c v" . bibtex-validate)
              ("C-c s" . bibtex-sort-buffer)
              ([down-mouse-3] . imenu))
  :config
  (setq
   bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries t))
```

I've been using `mu4e` for some years now, and I really love it. However, I'm also a Gmail user, don't love it, but consider myself stuck with it (given budget constraints and it being my email for several years already). This makes me always weary of "the next Google shenanigan" which might break my workflow. One of the things I have learned to cherish about using `mu4e` is its integration with Org, with it's `org-capture` support, which enables me not to confuse my Inbox with my todo list, thus keeping my Inbox clean. So I came up with a preventive function, leveraging `org-protocol` to be able to capture a Gmail message from a bookmarklet on the browser.  Not particularly pretty code, but functional.

```elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Add org-protocol to capture email in Gmail.
  (add-to-list 'org-protocol-protocol-alist
               '("org-gmail-capture" :protocol "gmail-capture"
                 :function gb/org-protocol-gmail-capture))

  ;; Bookmarklet:
  ;;   javascript:location.href = 'org-protocol://gmail-capture?' +
  ;;       new URLSearchParams({
  ;;           msg: document.getElementById("raw_message_text").innerHTML});
  ;; Must be called from the "Original message" page.
  (defun gb/org-protocol-gmail-capture (info)
    "Process an org-protocol://gmail-capture style url with INFO.

This function detects the raw message text element from the \"Original
message\" page of a Gmail message.  It then parses relevant message
fields and calls the \"email\" org-capture template.

The location for a browser's bookmark looks like this:

  javascript:location.href = \\='org-protocol://gmail-capture?\\=' +
      new URLSearchParams({
          msg: document.getElementById(\"raw_message_text\").innerHTML});

The sub-protocol used to reach this function is set in
`org-protocol-protocol-alist'."
    (when-let* ((parts (org-protocol-parse-parameters info))
                (msg (plist-get parts ':msg)))
      ;; FIXME I'm not sure why this is needed, but the protocol fails on a
      ;; fresh session (before 'org-capture' is loaded), and the new frame
      ;; just flashes on the screen.
      (require 'org-capture)
      (let (subj id to from date
            from-name from-email to-name to-email from-to-name)

          ;; really the "original" it is rather a html rendered version of

  (defun gb/org-link-gmail-open (link _)

```
The corresponding bookmarklet is:

```elisp
javascript:location.href = 'org-protocol://gmail-capture?' + new URLSearchParams({msg: document.getElementById("raw_message_text").innerHTML});

```
This must be called from the "Original message" page (which you can get with the "Show original" menu item). It won't work elsewhere.

The link created is a `gmail:` type link which essentially just copies `rfc822msgid:<messageID>` to the kill-ring/clipboard, which you can paste in Gmail's search bar to go to the message of interest.

Not that it matters much, but the corresponding capture template is:


```elisp
      ("e" "email" entry
       (file+headline (lambda ()
                        (expand-file-name gb/email-capture-file
                                          gb/org-files-directory))
                      "Email")
       "* TODO %?%:description %(org-set-tags \":email:\")

`M-x quick-calc` (which I've bound to `C-=`).  Calc is insanely complex, but this lets you do simple calculations quickly.

Like Magit? Like writing TODOs in your source code? Check out: 

https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos

It uses simple programs like grep or rgrep to show the TODOs in your git repo.

Most of the time when I need to basic calculations, `quick-calc` is enough, no need to fire up `calc`.

But sometimes it is nice to keep the expression as well, for modifying/copying the expression for further calculations.

Also, for example, when planning costs for a project it is nice to keep expressions and results with comments in an org file for future reference.

So I set up this basic function for calculating the expression written on the current line and then **insert the result on the next line**. Bound to <H-return> for easy access without conflicting with other modes.
Nothing fancy, and requires the expression to be on a single line. It can probably be improved a lot, but it does what I intended already.

That said, improvements and suggestions are very welcome, my current elisp skills mostly extends to copy and pasting online example code. :)


```elisp
(defun w0w-calculator ()
  "Calculate math expression on current line using calc-eval"
  (interactive)
  (setq cLine
      (buffer-substring-no-properties
       (line-beginning-position)
       (line-end-position)))
  (save-excursion
    (end-of-line)
    (open-line 1))
  (forward-line 1)
  (insert(calc-eval '("evalv($)" calc-internal-prec 18) 'num cLine)))

(global-set-key (kbd "<H-return>") 'w0w-calculator)    

```
Usage, on a single line, write some math, and then press `<H-return>`

```elisp
125*2+3^2 ;; press <H-return>
259       ;; answer given and inserted in buffer
```

To replace a shell command with its output, select the command and type `C-u M-| sh`. It can work because bash supports read program via STDIN, Python and Ruby work as well.

This seems almost too basic to mention, but it's handy:

```elisp
(defun add-to-hooks (func &rest hooks)
  (dolist (hook hooks) (add-hook hook func)))

```
Then, for example:

```elisp

  'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
  'scheme-mode-hook
  'lisp-mode-hook
  'clojure-mode-hook

Working in education, I often find myself having to assign students into groups. This week I made a function in ELisp that helps me do this. Select a region in a buffer that contains a list of students (presumably), call this function, say how many students should be in each group and the function then randomly assigns groups.

```elisp

                  (setf (elt list-to-swap i2) tmp)))))
    (dotimes (i (length input) input)

Not very well-known, but Emacs has its own spreadsheet and file format (`.ses`) (`ses-mode`). It supports many advanced features, and formulas are written in Elisp.

Last night I wrote some code to improve syntax highlighting for CHICKEN Scheme files. Normally regular `scheme-mode` is sufficient, unfortunately it doesn't handle the non-standard heredoc and `#> ... <#` syntax:

```elisp

You can use EWW to bypass pay-walls on news sites, and other Javascript-enabled nastiness. Plus, eww can copy from what it sees into equivalent orgmode syntax, and it's also compatible with SPRAY for speed-reading. In otherwords, EWW is great for when you just need to READ the internet.

Unlike many applications' [Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(user_interface)), the Emacs region doesn't need to be highlighted to work. The Emacs region is the range of mark and point, mark is usually an old point, for example, many movement commands such as M-> and C-s automatically stores the starting point as the mark, thus the region is available once the command ends, for example, to select the whole buffer without highlighting, you can use

```elisp
M-> M-<

```
Highlighted region is also called active region. Many commands doesn't care if the region is active or inactive, both of them works.

This is familiar to me. I've been using emacs for 10 years but I felt as you do for perhaps as long as two months.

If you take the approach of trying to make emacs be just like the environments you are used to then a) you will be disappointed and b) why bother?

For me the joy of emacs comes from discovering its thoughtful and pragmatic design. The keys which initially seem hard actually involve lite hand movement. The help system is discoverable and well thought out once you can navigate it easily.

Seek out emacs users and ask them how they do the most mundane things. As an example when I'm working in a project I often navigate it by using rgrep and choosing a buffer that way. The bookmarks system is very handy. Once you have a bunch of files open already switch between them using c-x b. various extensions make this better like iBuffer.

Seek out cool extensions that help you with ruby. Discovering a cool new trick keeps you enthused and helps you through the helpless stage.

Learning emacs is a journey and some of that journey is uphill. As long as you're enjoying yourself carry on. If you're not though, it's probably just not for you.

You'll need to either adapt to the Emacs way of doing things, or make Emacs to adapt to your way of doing things. For the specific problem you described, if you want to adapt, install [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), and you can open files quickly using `C-c p f` (hint: it is similar to ST's `Ctrp-P`. If you love NERDTree and doesn't want to switch to a new way and Speedbar doesn't work for you, install [Neotree](https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree) instead.

`image-mode` can be used to preview TTF and OTF fonts.

Emacs already opens TTF fonts with `image-mode` automatically, but I also wanted it to do the same with OTF.

Inspired by the venerable Twitch [Stay Healthy Bot](https://www.twitch.tv/stayhealthybot), I decided to do up a similar reminder feature from my local Emacs. It's more or less just a timer mixed with alert.el. There's still some work do be done here (mostly in regards to resetting the timer, as my usual workflow is to close out Emacs at the end of the workday), but I've found it pretty useful during the workday to keep me hydrated and moving around.

```elisp
(use-package alert
  :config
  ;; OS-dependent
  (setq alert-default-style 'osx-notifier)

  ;; Reminder to stay healthy!
  (defvar stay-healthy--start nil)
  (defvar stay-healthy--timer nil)
  (defun stay-healthy--alert (start-time)
    "Alert the user to stay healthy"
    (let* ((now (time-to-seconds (current-time)))
           (seconds (- now start-time))
           (hours (format-seconds "%h" seconds)))
      (unless (string= hours "0")
        (alert
         (format "You've been working for %s hour(s)! Have you been drinking your water? It might also be a good time to get up and stretch, refill your water, grab something to eat, or maybe take a bathroom break! Stay Healthy!"
                 hours)
         :title "Stay Healthy!"
         ))))

  (defun stay-healthy-start-timer ()
    "Start a timer to keep you healthy"
    (interactive)
    (unless stay-healthy--start
      (setq stay-healthy--start (time-to-seconds (current-time))))

I find `M-\` preferable to a separate `hungry-delete` package (i.e. do it if that's what you mean to do, but not otherwise).

or `M-SPC` to call `just-one-space` if that's what you mean to do.

or bind something to `cycle-spacing`.

`C-l` `(recenter-top-bottom)` is a known command that "recenters" the window around point by scrolling to the top, center, bottom.

But there's a no so well-known version, `C-M-l` `(reposition-window)`, that intelligently scrolls the buffer so that the function under point is fully visible, etc. It's very useful for programming languages modes.

In the spirit of `incf` this is an abstraction to toggle a truth value without having to write the place twice.

E.g. write `(togglef foo)` instead of `(setf foo (not foo))`.

```elisp
(defmacro togglef (place)
  "Toggle PLACE.  non-nil becomes nil, nil becomes t.
PLACE may be a symbol, or any generalized variable allowed by ‚Äòsetf‚Äô.
The return value is the new value of PLACE."
  `(setf ,place (not ,place)))

Bit of code to flip the window split from horizontal to vertical or vice versa.  Been in my .emacs almost since the beginning, so unfortunately I don't know where I got it from.  I use it when I switch emacs from half screen to full screen.

```elisp

This is a classic "Wow, Emacs does that?" situation: I discovered `imenu` by accident this week.

On the one hand, it's a great tool for finding definitions in code -- but because my main use of Emacs is for writing and PIM, the thing that really excited me was `imenu-add-menubar-index`. 

In org files, it treats each heading as a part of the index -- so by adding `imenu` to the menu bar, I have fly-out navigation for large org files. (I know people hate the menu bar, but I've found it handy). 

That's all well and good, but now add in the `imenu-list`package, and you have a little pop-up outline of your org file just one keypress away: it's like the bookmarks in a PDF, and has been really helpful already in getting around. Light, clean, easy.

Customizing `org-imenu-depth` sets how deep into a nested hierarchy to index for either `imenu-list` or the menubar index.

(defun enable-pair-programming-mode ()
  "Sets visuals for pair programming mode and prompt for your buddy."

(setq pair-programming--pair-programmer pair-programmer)
(message (concat "Pair programming with " (car pair-programmer)))))

(defun disable-pair-programming-mode ()
  "Disable pair programming visuals and settings."
  (setq pair-programming--pair-programmer nil)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode -1)
  (message "PP mode disabled"))

(define-minor-mode pair-programming-mode ()
  "Toggle Pair Programming Mode.

This prompts for a pair programmer from your current git commit history.
When you commit with (ma)git, the pair programmer is inserted as a co-author.
Additionally, line number mode is enabled."
  :global t
  :lighter " PP"
  (if pair-programming-mode
  (enable-pair-programming-mode)
(disable-pair-programming-mode)))

(defun insert-pair-programmer-as-coauthor ()
  "Insert your pair programer into the current git commit."
  (when (and pair-programming-mode git-commit-mode)
(pcase pair-programming--pair-programmer
  (`(,name ,email) (git-commit-insert-header "Co-authed-by" name email))
  (_ (error "No pair programmer found or wrong content")))))

(add-hook 'git-commit-setup-hook 'insert-pair-programmer-as-coauthor)
```

It sets up a co-authored-by for git commits, and enables line numbers.

I've read many blog posts touting the benefits of a literate emacs configuration. They say things about it making code easier to read and understand, and about being able to use org-mode itself to manipulate your code. But among the many benefits, I typically don't see much talk about programmatically exploiting the fact that your code is divided into executable sections based on some category. I also haven't seen many configurations exploit this either.

One exception is [noctuid's config](https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.emacs.d). He uses it to address the problem of [how to gracefully handle errors in your init file](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/669/how-to-gracefully-handle-errors-in-init-file).

This is not a new problem. In fact, this was mentioned by [clemera](https://www.reddit.com/user/clemera) in [the first trial of weekly tips and tricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/aja311/first_trial_of_a_weekly_emacs_tipstricksetc_thread/). There he suggested binding \`C-x C-c\` to a function that runs your \`init.el\` file in an external process and prevents you from quitting if there are any errors. Although this solution gets the job done and is certainly better than nothing, I was not too fond of it for a couple of reasons.

(1) It makes exiting emacs take a long time because just before exiting you're now loading your *entire* config to check if there are any errors. I like my commands to be snappy and quick.  (2) It happens when I'm exiting emacs. If I'm exiting emacs, it's likely for a good reason (I have something else I want to do). I don't in general like emacs preventing me from quitting it, unless it's just prompting me to save files. (3) You're almost forced to fix the problem right there and then. If you don't and you leave, your \`init.el\` file wont run next time you start emacs.

The way noctuid handled this is wrapping the code in his source blocks with \`with-demoted-errors\` with a [custom tangle function](https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/lisp/noct-util.el). The nice things about this method is you're not forced to fix the problem immediately: if there's an error in your config, it will just skip the error in the section, and run the rest of your config. This means that if you're pressed for time you can get whatever you wanted to get done and quit emacs without fear of not being able to start it up again. Also, it's efficient in the sense that you don't have to run your config two times (one time for setting up emacs and one time at the end to catch errors), it's all done at startup.

In this post I want to point out that what noctuid does is not something we need a literate config to do. I tried literate programming and I (as well as some [others](https://valignatev.com/posts/emacs-org-config/)) have emerged dissatisfied. The drawbacks of a literate configuration are many. Among the most notable are (1) the additional complexity from tangling (2) the annoyance of having to enter an elisp block every time you want to edit the code (3) the additional overhead of having to load org mode when opening your init file (4) *duality* \- having 2 files with the same information that need to be synced (the init elisp file and the init org file).

To achieve something like noctuid and still have an elisp init file, I am considering writing a macro \`elisp-block!\` which will function similarly to org-mode's \`#+BEGIN\_SRC\` syntax except for one key difference. Org source blocks do nothing on their own, they're just syntax markers for org mode whereas \`elisp-block!\` is also a *macro*. What this means is that the *vast majority of the code in our \`init.el\` file will be* *in a macro* (the only thing that can't be in the macro is the \`elisp-block!\` itself)*.* This give us an obscene amount of power.

There are many possibilities of what we can do with this, but I will give a taste:

```elisp
(defvar blacklisted-elisp-block-categories nil
  "Names of elisp blocks that will not be evaled")

(defvar init-file-errors nil "Errors during startup.")

(defmacro elisp-block! (name category &rest code)
  (declare (indent 2))
  `(unless (memq ,category blacklisted-elisp-block-categories)
     (condition-case init-error
         (progn ,@code)
       (error
        (push ,category blacklisted-elisp-block-categories)
        (push init-error init-file-errors)
        (message
         (format "%S in source block %S of category %S\n"
                 (car init-error)
                 ,name
                 ,category))))))

```
\`elisp-block!\` will catch any errors in CODE and print them out instead of raising them (and interrupting execution of your \`init.el\`). It will also tell you the specific block where that happened in the message and store the error in case you want to see what it was later. Finally, it will ensure that subsequent blocks of the same category are not run by adding their categories to \`blacklisted-elisp-blocks\`. In effect, this will ensure that any code that depends on a particular elisp block that has an error will not be run.

The main drawback to \`elisp-block!\` is that it will be littered throughout the \`init.el\`. Yet perhaps this is not so bad, I mean we do this with \`use-package\` as well. In any case, IMO the benefits outweigh the costs.

I just now figured out that you can interactively pass flags to commands like `counsel-rg` by putting the `--` separator between the flags and the search string, so something like `-g '*.txt' -- whatever` will search for `whatever` only in `txt` files. `counsel` uses a function called `counsel--split-command-args` to split the parts before and after the `--`.

On a Mac: make Emacs detect if you have light or dark mode enabled system wide.

If you have two themes, a light one and a dark one, and you want the dark theme by default unless you have light mode enabled, add this to your init.el:

```elisp
;; If we're on a Mac and the file "~/bin/get_dark.osascript" exists
;; and it outputs "false", activate light mode. Otherwise activate
;; dark mode.
(cond ((and (file-exists-p "~/bin/get_dark.osascript")
            (string> (shell-command-to-string "command -v osascript") "")
            (equal "false\n"
                   (shell-command-to-string "osascript ~/bin/get_dark.osascript")))
       (mcj/theme-set-light))
      (t (mcj/theme-set-dark)))

```
(mcj/theme-set-light and mcj/theme-set-light are functions that enable the light and the dark theme, respectively).

~/bin/get_dark.osascript contains the following:

```elisp
tell application "System Events"
	tell appearance preferences
		get dark mode
	end tell
end tell
```

Most people probably know that `M-t` (`transpose-words`) when used between two words swaps them. But it has other a few other features that are useful:

- You don't have to be between words to use it: if you are on a word, from the second character on, it will swap that word with the next.

- If you are at the end of the buffer and use it you get an error message, "Don‚Äôt have two things to transpose", _but_ you additionally get placed at the beginning of the last word in the buffer. So `M-t M-t` used at the end of the buffer will swap the last two words!

- You can use it to swap _non-adjacent_ words too! If you call it with a numeric argument of 0, it will swap the word at the start of the region with the next word after the end of the region. For example, say you want to swap "two" with "five" in the following line:

```elisp
  one five three four two six

```
  You can mark the words "five three four" (but don't mark "two") and then `M-0 M-t` will swap "five", the first word in the region, with "two" the first word _after_ the region.

That last trick works with the other `transpose-` commands as well, not just words: `transpose-chars`, `transpose-lines`, `transpose-paragraphs`, `transpose-sentences`, and `transpose-sexps`. Of course, if that `C-0` trick can't be used with any of those commands to swap the two things you want, there is always `transpose-regions`.

I tend to have a lot of function that is defined solely to be added to a hook. Turns out I can customize `defun-declarations-alist` to define a new `hook` property in the `declare` form. Now I can specify the hook that the function is intended for right inside the function definition.

```elisp
;; Need to be done during compilation as well if your functions are getting compiled
(eval-and-compile
  (setf (alist-get 'hook defun-declarations-alist)
        (list (lambda (fun _args hook &optional depth)
                `(add-hook ',hook #',fun ,@(when depth (list depth)))))))

(defun ask-about-scratch-buffer ()
  "Confirm that user want to discard the content of the scratch buffer."
  (declare (hook kill-emacs-query-functions))
  (let ((scratch (get-buffer "*scratch*")))
    (or (zerop (buffer-size scratch))
        (progn (pop-to-buffer scratch)
               (y-or-n-p "Scratch buffer is not empty, discard?")))))
;; no longer needed
;; (add-hook 'kill-emacs-query-functions #'ask-about-scratch-buffer)

The `table` package is very useful and not very popular in Emacs (it's included by default).

Imagine that you have some text that is more or less structured like a table, but not quite. For example it may be some text where you applied a "table-like" layout manually by using a lot of spaces, but the structure is big and things are difficult to maintain. You can select the text, do `M-x table-capture`, and specify empty strings as separators. Emacs will create a pretty table with one cell containing your text. Now you can move the point to parts inside that cell and split around that point with `M-x split-cell`. Once a cell is split, you can navigate each cell with Tab and edit text independently! After you have finished creating a layout, just do `M-x table-release` and everything will be in plain text again, keeping your layout intact.

`table` is a useful package to create complex layouts in code comments (for example, to explain a difficult concept).

For more information, check "Editing Text-based Tables" in the Emacs manual.

A bunch of useful built-in commands have no default keybinding. Here's a list that includes the binding I use as suggestion:

- List editing commands:
  - `up-list` (`C-M-o` --mnemonic: it gets you Out of a list)
  - `kill-backward-up-list` (`<C-M-backspace>`)
  - `raise-sexp` (`M-R`)
  
- Prose oriented commands:
  - `kill-paragraph` (`M-K`)
  - `mark-end-of-sentence` (`M-E`)
  - `transpose-sentences` (`M-T`)
  - `transpose-paragraphs` (`C-x t`)
  
- Miscellaneous:
  - `browse-url-at-point` (`C-c b`) Of course, if you use `goto-address-mode`, you don't need a keybinding for this one.
  - `info-apropos` (`C-h A`)
  - `proced` (`C-x C-p`) It works on Windows too!

Also, there are a bunch of default keybindings that I think could be better used for a very similar command:

- `C-d`. It is usually bound to `delete-char`, but even the help for `delete-char` thinks this is a bad idea!:
   
   > The command ‚Äòdelete-forward-char‚Äô is preferable for interactive use, e.g.
   > because it respects values of ‚Äòdelete-active-region‚Äô and ‚Äòoverwrite-mode‚Äô.

  So I bind `C-d` to `delete-forward-char` and enjoy the `delete-active-region` goodness.
  
- `C-x k`. I use it for `kill-current-buffer` and use `C-x K` for `kill-buffer`.

- `M-z`. It's normally bound to `zap-to-char` but I find `zap-up-to-char` useful more often, so I bind it to `M-z` and put `zap-to-char` on `M-Z`.

- `M-c`, `M-l`, `M-u`. These are bound to `capitalize-word`, `downcase-word` and `upcase-word`, but I think `capitalize-dwim`, `downcase-dwim` and `upcase-dwim` are strictly better: they act like the `-word` versions when no region is active, and like the `-region` versions  when there is an active region.

I use a lot of toggles in my config. I used to do it ad-hoc every time, but the pattern ends up the same so I made this macro:
```elisp
(defun deftoggle-var-doc (name)
  (concat "Non-nil if " name " is enabled.\n\n"
      "See " name
      " command for a description of this toggle."))
(defun deftoggle-fun-doc (name doc)
  (concat "Toggle " name " on or off.\n\n" doc))
(defmacro deftoggle (name doc enabler disabler)
  `(progn
 (defvar ,name nil ,(deftoggle-var-doc (symbol-name name)))
 (defun ,name (&optional enable)
   ,(deftoggle-fun-doc (symbol-name name) doc)
   (interactive)
   (if (called-interactively-p 'interactive)
       (progn
         (if ,name
             ,disabler
           ,enabler)
         (setq ,name (not ,name)))
     (progn
       (if enable
           ,enabler
         ,disabler)
       (setq ,name enable))))))
```

It's very similar to define-minor-mode, but with all the hooks, keymaps, and lighters stripped out, so it's less verbose. Here I use it to toggle my theme for example:
```elisp
(deftoggle sam-toggle-theme
  "Toggle theme between light and dark."
  (progn (disable-theme 'dracula)
     (load-theme 'spacemacs-light t))
  (progn (disable-theme 'spacemacs-light)
     (load-theme 'dracula t)))
```

Here are some things I've gathered while reading through the Emacs info pages.

* In i-search, you can do `M-e` to edit the current search string, and search with the new string by using `C-s`  or `C-r` and whatnot. This may be common knowledge, but I at least didn't know of this until recently. I tended to try to press backspace to edit the search query, but that tends to first go back the found matches before allowing you to edit again.
* If one wants to have a built-in completion thing for the minibuffer, I recommend giving `icomplete-mode` a try. Like `ido-mode`, `icomplete-mode` is built into Emacs, which gives it certain advantages when compared against things like `helm` and `ivy`.  
  
Now, unlike `ido`, `icomplete-mode` applies to everything by default, without the need for settings like `ido-everywhere`. This also means that `icomplete` works with `M-x` out of the box, instead of needing a thing like `smex`.

Reading the Emacs manual is quite a nice thing. It can be quite long in some places, but one might discover something new, and maybe find out just what Emacs is capable of, even in a basic OOTB configuration.

Maybe you already know about `occur`, which shows matching lines in the current buffer -- like grep, but the buffer doesn't need to be backed by a file.

Emacs also has `multi-occur` which does the same thing across multiple buffers (you have to specify each one); and `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers`, which matches lines across buffers whose name matches a regexp'.

Most of the time, I want to search *all* open buffers, so I wrote:

```elisp
(defun multi-occur-global (regexp &optional nlines)
  "Do a `multi-occur' across all buffers."
  (interactive (occur-read-primary-args))
  (thread-first
  ;; Don't occur in *Occur* buffers
  (lambda (buffer) (eq (buffer-local-value 'major-mode buffer) 'occur-mode))
(cl-remove-if (buffer-list))
(multi-occur regexp)))
```

This is great if you have IRC chats or emails open in Emacs and need to quickly find a previous conversation.  And of course `occur` works properly with `next-error` / `previous-error` just like the `grep` commands do.

```elisp

plus a simple function to replace kill-buffer so that it kill the current buffer without prompting me for what buffer I want to kill(the docstring is mine):

```elisp
(defun my-kill-this-buffer ()
  "Kill the current buffer. This function is required because the
`kill-this-buffer' included in Emacs is safe to use only
from the menu bar"
  (interactive)
  (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))

Evil related:

An interesting thing I read in the past week was this [blog post](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2014/02/follow-my-leader/). What I got out of it is that, although vi keybinds cover almost all keys, leaving you with few free keys to change, a significant amount of combinations of keys are invalid (for example c followed by x doesn't do anything) and thus you can bind them to whatever you want. 

I have not integrated this idea to my evil workflow yet, but it sounds quite promising, and I think I'll start using it at some point. 

(One thing to consider though is that with evil there are packages that add additional text objects. If you added a text object that is represented by x then c followed by x would become a valid combination and thus would clash with your keybinding, forcing you to change it to something else)

If you're using the default VIM mode keybindings, it sounds like you've really fallen for the VIM-style modal workflow.

If I have a file that I'd like to live in a Git repo, but I don't want to have to bother telling Git to ignore it, I'll just create it elsewhere but then put a line at the top like:

```elisp
# -*- default-directory: "/path/to/repo/"; -*-

```
The file then lives in the repo for nearly all intents and purposes, despite being stored elsewhere.  For example, if I run a shell command while visiting the file, the shell is run in the repo directory; Projectile commands can be run in the repo while visiting the file; etc.  Very handy!

I've used orgmode a lot, Evernote only a little. Orgmode works best when your notes are stored as "children" within a single large outline (or a small number of outlines, e.g. one per large topic). Storing hundreds of individual files doesn't work so well.

It is possible for orgmode to display images inline by default - there is a variable that controls that (org-startup-with-inline-images) or you can put this line in your orgmode file:

```elisp
#+STARTUP: inlineimages

```
You can apply multiple tags to items in orgmode files, although the tags are crowded onto the end of the item's headline so it can get cumbersome and ugly if an item has more than a handful of tags.

Adding notes can be done very efficiently in orgmode using the "capture" functionality. You can add notes based on different predefined templates by associating each template with a hotkey. You can even set up a bookmark in your web browser that will add highlighted text as a new orgmode note when you click it (see "org-protocol" in the manual).

The main problem with orgmode is that it is completely dependent on Emacs. Essentially no other program understands the orgmode format, beyond the fact that it is based on plain text. There is a mobile app ([MobileOrg](http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/)) but it seems to be seldom updated and I have not found it useful. There are also modules that attempt to integrate orgmode with [Toodledo](http://toodledoo.com) and [Trello](http://trello.com). However, if you rely on orgmode then you should be aware that it will be difficult for you to interact with your notes database when you are not sitting in front of a computer running Emacs.

For notes, I use [SimpleNote](http://simplenote.com) (free, available for most platforms + web client, syncs your notes, plain text but also allows tagging of notes). For task management, orgmode is the most powerful piece of software available -- no contest -- but because of its mobile-unfriendliness I have ended up using OmniFocus instead (Mac/iOS only).

Another alternative to consider is Microsoft OneNote, which is free and is available on a lot of platforms. I don't think MS will be disappearing any time soon.

Just a cool concept: if you have a keypad on your keyboard which you rarely use, bind its nums to something useful. The results are numlock-sensitive and are NOT the same keycodes as regular numbers, so they're just free keys. For example, `(define-key map (kbd "<kp-1>") 'winum-select-window-1)`

I just found out that the tables in `org-mode` support Excel-like calculations.  You can use functions from `calc` as well as arbitrary Elisp expressions!

Only complaint is that it's not the most performant. I tested it on a table of ~1200 rows and it took around 8 seconds to update my calculated column. :/

Moving, marking & killing by paragraph.

I've been using these for a while as a customisation of Xah-Fly-Keys, but I was surprised to learn that many Emacs users don't know this functionality.

I find that moving by paragraph is a good middle ground between moving vertically by line and moving vertically by page, it's a very natural hierarchy.

I move the page to display the correct section of the buffer, then I move to the right paragraph, then to the right line within that paragraph.

The default bindings for movement are annoying, `M-{`/`M-}`, but it's simple enough to rebind them to `M-[`/`M-]`.

You can mark the current paragraph with `M-h`.

To log in to Slack I need a client ID, a client secret, and a token.  I don't want to store them in my `.emacs` file, since I share that publicly.

I use Emacs on my laptop either undocked, either with external screens connected. It used to be manual work of dragging and resizing frames around, and then setting up windows, but no more, thanks to the great [dispwatch](https://github.com/mnp/dispwatch) package, which handles the screen changes after Emacs has been started. I [wrote some code](https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/emacs/setup.el#L154) for the initial frame setup, and now have this, which makes the docking/undocking fully seamless:

I thought it might be a fun project to make a package to expose org-capture templates as endpoints, so I can add reminders to my TODO list via any device on the network. Turns out, it was easy enough that a package would be kinda pointless:

```elisp
(defservlet* capture/:keys/:contents text/plain () (org-capture-string contents keys))

```
Now I can hit "localhost:8080/capture/t/test reminder" and it'll put a "* TODO test reminder" line into my todo.org. Neat!

The `git grep` git command is great for finding a regex (or a simple string) everywhere in a git repo. I define the following functions and bind the `git-grep` function to `F2`. It will prompt for a regex and search for that in the repo or, if you give it a numeric prefix like `C-u` it will read the current symbol at point (the word under the cursor) and search for that. Results appear in a grep buffer, so you can use `C-g C-n` and `C-g C-p` to navigate from one result to the next.

```elisp
(defun git-root-dir ()
  "Returns the current directory's root Git repo directory, or
NIL if the current directory is not in a Git repo."
  (let ((dir (locate-dominating-file default-directory ".git")))
    (when dir
      (file-name-directory dir))))

(defun git-grep (arg)
  "Runs 'git grep', starting the search in the current
directory's root git repo directory.

By default, reads the regex from the minibuffer. With a prefix
argument, initializes the search string with the current symbol
at point."
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((symbol-at-point (thing-at-point 'symbol))
         (regexp (if (and arg (symbol-at-point))
                   (regexp-quote symbol-at-point)
                     (read-from-minibuffer
                      "Search regexp: " nil nil nil 'grep-find-history)))

         (default-directory (git-root-dir))
         (case-ignore-flag (and (isearch-no-upper-case-p regexp t) "-i"))
         (cmd (concat "git grep --extended-regexp --line-number --full-name"
                      " --untracked " case-ignore-flag " -- \"" regexp "\""
                      " | cut -c -240")))
    (while (equal "" regexp)
        (setq regexp (read-from-minibuffer
                      "Search regexp (must not be the empty string): " nil nil nil 'grep-find-history)))
    (grep-find cmd)))
```

I sometimes clone stuff with https instead of ssh, so this fixes that:

```elisp
(defun isamert/git-origin-switch-to-ssh ()
  (interactive)
  (when-let* ((https-origin (s-trim (shell-command-to-string "git config --get remote.origin.url")))
              (it (s-match "https://\\(.*\\)\\.\\(com\\|net\\|org\\)/\\(.*\\)" https-origin))
              (ssh-origin (format "git@%s.%s:%s" (nth 1 it) (nth 2 it) (nth 3 it))))
    (shell-command-to-string (format "git remote set-url origin %s" ssh-origin))))


```
It works for github/gitlab etc. You need to extend the regexp for making it work for more obscure addresses.

-	You can redefine all yes/no prompts to y/n:
`(defalias ‚Äòyes-or-no-p ‚Äòy-or-n-p)`

-	`C-c C-c` in LaTeX-mode buffers will allow you to compile/view output (I‚Äôve used LaTeX-preview-pane for the last couple of years)

-	Tab-stops in yas-snippet are very handy for filling out multiple parts of a template, didn‚Äôt even know these existed:

If you:

1. Develop code on remote machine;
2. Use SSH to access remote; and
3. Annoyed by `flycheck` not working properly over TRAMP

Then consider using [`sshfs`](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) to mount your remote filesystem to local. This way, `flycheck` will regard your files just as a local one, and works properly. Neat trick discovered today when debugging flycheck-flake8 with my colleague (are you reading? :P)

I've been using `M-|` (`shell-command-on-region`) frequently for years, and I only just stumbled on the fact that the region need not be active to use it.  If it isn't, the command operates on the text from point to the end of the buffer.  That's very reasonable and in line with various other commands, but the documentation doesn't mention it and so I never thought to try it.

That saves me a call to `C-x h` (`mark-whole-buffer`) whenever I want to process the entire buffer, which is most of the time.  Also, it's a minor distraction for the entire buffer to be highlighted when I'm composing my shell command, so it's nice to avoid that.

Edited to add:  Sorry folks, this doesn't work like I thought it did.  See the coments below for details.

If you want executions of keyboard macros to undo in a single step, you can use the `undo-amalgamate-change-group` function that was added in Emacs 26.1:

```elisp
(defun block-undo (fn &rest args)
  (let ((marker (prepare-change-group)))
    (unwind-protect (apply fn args)
      (undo-amalgamate-change-group marker))))

(dolist (fn '(kmacro-call-macro kmacro-exec-ring-item))
  (advice-add fn :around #'block-undo))

```
And, of course, you can add that advice to other ready made functions you'd like to be able to undo in a single step. (I haven't found any examples in stock Emacs other than keyboard macros, where I want that behavior and don't already have it, but who knows). For new commands you write, it is probably best to use `undo-amalgamate-change-group` in the implementation rather than advising.

`rx` isn't just an (extensible!) sexp syntax for regexps, it's an optimizing compiler!

Examples:

-   `(rx (or "dude@home.org" "dude@work.com"))` produces
```elisp
`"\\(?:dude@\\(?:home\\.org\\|work\\.com\\)\\)"`
```
-   `(rx (intersection (any (?g . ?z)) (any (?a . ?p))))` produces  `"[g-p]"`

And from Lisp code it's easy to plug in computed portions, using `eval`.
For example I recently used this in some silly code to count mentions
of animals in the bible :P:

```elisp
(defun plural (word)
  (pcase word
    ("mouse" "mice")
    ("wolf" "wolves")
    ("fish" "fishes")
    (word (concat word "s"))))

(defun bible-count (word)
  "Count number of times WORD or its plural appears in the bible."
  (with-current-buffer "king-james-bible.txt"
    (count-matches
      (rx-to-string `(word-start (or ,word ,(plural word)) word-end)))))

```
Which I used to make an Org mode table with an Emacs Lisp column formula:

```elisp
#+TBLFM: $2='(bible-count $1)

```
**EDIT**:  A previous version of the `bible-count` function used the `rx` macro and the `eval` construct:

```elisp
(defun bible-count (word)
  "Count number of times WORD or its plural appears in the bible."
  (with-current-buffer "king-james-bible.txt"
    (count-matches (rx word-start
                       (or (eval word) (eval (plural word)))
                       word-end))))

```
This version is incorrect: `eval` is meant to be used only for value known at compile time. It's actual [behavior is very complicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g5bat3/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/fo7qdas) and depends on plenty of seemingly extraneous circumstances.

Emacs has better long-lines support now??

I just noticed while looking at the latest additions in the NEWS:

>\*\* Emacs is now capable of editing files with arbitrarily long lines. The display of long lines has been optimized, and Emacs no longer chokes when a buffer on display contains long lines.  If you still experience slowdowns while editing files with long lines, this is either due to font locking, which you can turn off with M-x font-lock-mode or C-u C-x x f, or to the current major mode or one of the enabled minor modes, in which case you should open the the file with M-x find-file-literally instead of C-x C-f.  The variable 'long-line-threshold' controls whether and when these display optimizations are used.

That sounds like great news!  Does anyone know what went into it?

(edit to add: this was added some time this week.  I rebuild from master weekly, and check out the NEWS diff each time)

The other day I discovered that you can access Spotify through dbus. Most of my use-case for spotify is hitting shuffle on ~20 of my playlists; not much searching, discovering, charts, etc. So, I didn't need any of the existing packages that require an auth token or extra local server.

This basically wraps `completing-read` over the alist stored in spotify-playlists. You can probably translate the qdbus call to dbus-send or whatever.

```elisp
;; Inspired by sp.sh: https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547
;; Could use https://codeberg.org/jao/espotify, but don't need all the functionalities
;; Potential Issues: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux/DBus-OpenUri-issue/td-p/1376397

;; Could just write a fn to extract the ID, and use that in spotify-playlists
;; Current way with full uri allows for playlist vs artist, etc.
;; but probably don't need flexiblity for my use case

If you want to switch between two themes, depending on time of day (e.g. a light and dark theme), it's as simple as this:

```elisp
;; Light
(load-theme 'modus-operandi t t)
(run-at-time "05:00" (* 60 60 24) (lambda () (enable-theme 'modus-operandi))))

;; Dark
(load-theme 'modus-vivendi t t)
(run-at-time "21:00" (* 60 60 24) (lambda () (enable-theme 'modus-vivendi))))

```
This selects the correct theme when starting Emacs and automatically switch when the times come.

      initial-scratch-message "#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n;; This block is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.\n;; To create a file, visit it with \\[find-file] and enter text in its buffer.\n\n#+end_src\n\n")

evil-mode trick: you could use elisp in the `ex` when using substitute command using `\,`, for example: 

```elisp
%s/.*/\,(line-number-at-pos) \0 \,(length \0)
```

This will add line number at the beginning of the line and the line length in the end.

I keep forgetting how useful the `pcase` macro is.  Recently I wrote a command that expected to find a single jar file in a certain directory and operate on it.  I started with a more "traditional" implementation:

```elisp
(let ((jars (directory-files some-dir t (rx ".jar" eos))))
  (if (= 1 (length jars))
      (do-something-with (car jars))
    (error "Didn't find exactly one jar file")))

```
Then I remembered `pcase`:

```elisp
(pcase (directory-files some-dir t (rx ".jar" eos))
  (`(,jar) (do-something-with jar))
  (_ (error "Didn't find exactly one jar file")))

```
Much more readable!

Here's how I open pdf files in mupdf with the colors of my current emacs theme:

```elisp
(defun mupdf-reader (file)
  (let* ((background (face-attribute 'default :background))
         (foreground (face-attribute 'default :foreground))
         ;; if it's a hex code then remove the # prefix
         ;; if it's a color name then convert it to hex code
         (backg-color (if (equal (substring background 0 1) "#")
                          (substring background 1)
                        (substring (color-name-to-hex background) 1)))
         (font-color (if (equal (substring foreground 0 1) "#")
                         (substring foreground 1)
                       (substring (color-name-to-hex foreground) 1))))
    (make-process
     :name "book-reader"
     :connection-type 'pipe
     :command (list "mupdf-gl" "-B" font-color "-C" backg-color file))))

```
The above function depends on `color-name-to-hex`, which basically combines two inbuilt functions:

```elisp
(defun color-name-to-hex (name)
  (let ((rgb (color-name-to-rgb name)))
    (when rgb
      (setcdr (last rgb) '(2))
      (apply 'color-rgb-to-hex rgb))))

```
Here's a simple handler function to open all pdf and epub files from emacs with mupdf:

```elisp
(defun mupdf-file-handler (operation &rest args)
  (mupdf-reader (car args))
  (kill-buffer nil)
  ;; the error here is to avoid a bug that tries to
  ;; match the true filename with the deleted buffer
  (error ""))

```
Add the magic filenames to init.el so that emacs will know when to use the handler:

```elisp
(put 'mupdf-file-handler 'safe-magic t)
(put 'mupdf-file-handler 'operations '(insert-file-contents))
(add-to-list 'file-name-handler-alist '("\\(\\.\\(?:epub\\|pdf\\)\\)$" . mupdf-file-handler))
```

Skeletons are one of Emacs' killer features, especially when combined with `abbrev-mode`. Here's a macro I wrote to make them a little easier to handle:

```elisp
(defmacro snip (name &rest skeleton)
  (let* ((snip-name (symbol-name `,name))
         (func-name (intern (concat "snip-" snip-name))))
    `(progn
       (define-skeleton ,func-name
         ,(concat snip-name " skeleton")
         ,@skeleton)
       (define-abbrev global-abbrev-table ,snip-name
         "" ',func-name))))

```
Here's a simplistic example using the macro:

```elisp
(snip dd "" (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d"))

```
Now (assuming you have `abbrev-mode` enabled), type `dd ` into your buffer (that's `d` `d` `SPC`) and it'll be replaced with the current date.

This is just scratching the surface, skeletons are extremely powerful. Once you start using them they become a superpower and can take your Emacs usage to the next level.

I little advice I use in org-mode to auto load org-babel modules only when needed.
```elisp
  (defadvice org-babel-execute-src-block (around load-language nil activate)
  "Load ob-{language} only when needed."
  (let ((lang (org-element-property :language (org-element-at-point))))
(when (or (string= lang "bash") (string= lang "sh")) (setq lang "shell"))
(unless (cdr (assoc (intern lang) org-babel-load-languages))
  (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages (cons (intern lang) t))
  (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages))
ad-do-it))

```

Saves me some time and speeds up loading org-mode as a nice bonus.

P.S. Speaking of speeding up the loading of org-mode I found out that setting this before loading it helps a lot. Obviously one should modify it to include used modules/back-ends:
```elisp
(setq org-modules nil
  org-export-backends '(html)))
```

Idea: this thread could also double as a "help me implement this" thread.

Speaking of that: Is it possible to get atom-like completion suggestions before you start typing? I'm doing some CSS, and in Atom when you write something like

```elisp
.exampleclass {
    text-align: <cursor here>
}

```
Atom would give autocomplete-suggestions, displaying a list of possible values like "center", "left", "right". Company doesn't seem to do this.

Simple, but I think it counts as a tip: [minions](https://github.com/tarsius/minions) by [u/tarsius_](https://www.reddit.com/user/tarsius_). It allows one to invert the usual logic of managing minor modes lighters in the mode-line. While the default behaviour is "show everything by default, unless you diminish/delight it", `minions` goes in the opposite direction and hides all of them, unless you explicitly tell it to show them. Besides, the minor modes are still available, alongside some other common ones which thus become more easily accessible, in a menu which aggregates minor modes in the mode-line. Pretty neat.

I got tired of electric-pair-mode adding a closing parenthesis after I typed a frowny emoticon (`:(` or `:-(`), so:

```elisp
(setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate
      (lambda (c) (or (looking-back ":-?(" (- (point) 3)
                      (string-match-p (rx bos " *Minibuf-" (+ digit)) (buffer-name))
                      (electric-pair-default-inhibit c))))

```
(The matching against the buffer name had already been present.)

AucTeX

When you compile your TeX file and there are errors, the message asks you to see error messages using

```elisp
 C-c `

```
This leads to the last error which is sometimes incomprehensible and you are left to yourself to figure out what went wrong.

Instead of getting the last error, you can get an overview of all the errors by setting below variable to `t`:

```elisp
 (setq TeX-error-overview-open-after-TeX-run t)

```
You can pop this up in a separate frame using:

```elisp
  (setq TeX-error-overview-setup 'separate-frame)

```
Related docs are [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Error-overview.html).

This totally changes the way you can handle errors messages.

This is something I'm not actively using anymore, but it was one of my I-love-emacs moments, so I wanted to share this for a while.

At work, I used to have an org-mode journal where I would take meeting notes. After the meeting, I exported the subtree for the current meeting to a PDF (via ODT) and sent it to the participants via mail.

After a while I extended org-export to get a shortcut (`C-e C-s o M`) to automatically

* export to PDF via ODT
   * using a proper corporate design & logo via ODT\_STYLES\_FILE header
* rename the file to include the current date
* open thunderbird, starting a new message with
   * subject taken from document title (if exporting all) or subtree heading (if exporting subtree
   * pre-filled text
   * the exported PDF already attached

&#8203;

If you have an `ALTERNATE_EDITOR=''`environment variable, and start emacsclient with no emacs server running, it will start an emacs server and try starting emacsclient again. Also works with a `-a` flag on emacsclient command.

Question: I generally work with 3 vertical panes, with my preferred layout as left for code, middle for related test file, and right for test output or magit. However, keeping this layout is tricky; sometimes magit will open in the first pane, or the current pane when I'm focused in the middle, and deadgrep will open just anywhere‚Ä¶ well, it's quite hectic and feels random.

Is there any way I can get files to open in panes 1 or 2, and always have things like magit/test-output/deadgrep/etc on pane 3? I've tried "shackle" but I've had no success with it; everything seems to open in a horizontal pane at the bottom of my screen regardless of config.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Using [zotra](https://github.com/mpedramfar/zotra), [citar](https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar) and some parts of the Org-cite ecosystem I hacked together a highly experimental but pretty comfortable environment for working with "org-biblatex bibliographies" which are basically like [org-bibtex](http://gewhere.github.io/org-bibtex) but with biblatex entries represented as headings with suitable properties instead of bibtex. I have a function which retrieves a biblatex entry corresponding to an url using zotra and adds a corresponding Org heading with the biblatex fields as properties, and the entry becomes available in Citar as soon as I save the document. Citing these entries then works anywhere, even in the same document with a suitable `#+bibliography: my-org-biblatex-file.org` declaration. Exporting the citations also works with the CSL exporter, no conversion is necessary to a proper biblatex bibliography file (but can be easily done if one needs biblatex-based export). Since the bibliography is an Org document, tagging, agenda commands, column view etc. can all be used with the bibliography entries.  In a way it's frightening how much can be achieved building on already existing stuff and with a few lines of Emacs Lisp.

Prettify the minibuffer prompt on the default value

```elisp
(setq minibuffer-eldef-shorten-default t)
(minibuffer-electric-default-mode)

```
Then try eval

```elisp
(read-string "Year (default 2019): " nil nil "2019")

```
You will notice "Year (default 2019): " is shorten to "Year [2019]: ", and when
you enter anything, the prompt is shorten further to "Year: ". Next time, you
use the minibuffer api, if you provide the default value, don't forget to format
the prompt using that specfic format.

I found out that rather than having to jump to the mark, cancel, and restart, I can just press `C-x SPC` `[xfk: SPC r SPC]` `(rectangle-mark-mode)` and Emacs will toggle to the other selection scheme.

A colleague just showed me Intellij's "[compare with clipboard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/comparing-files-and-folders.html#clipboard)" feature: it's fairly neat, you select a region, invoke compare-with-clipboard and get a diff of the two selections.

It didn't take me long to implement something similar:

```elisp
(defun ediff-compare-region-clipboard (begin end)
  (interactive "r")
  (save-excursion
    (let ((selected-region (buffer-substring begin end))
          (clipboard-buffer (get-buffer-create "*ediff-clipboard*"))
          (region-buffer (get-buffer-create "*ediff-region*")))
      (with-current-buffer clipboard-buffer
        (insert (car kill-ring)))
      (with-current-buffer region-buffer
        (insert selected-region))
      (ediff-buffers clipboard-buffer region-buffer))))

```
It's not ideal though.  In particular, is there a better way to insert the "clipboard"?  One thing I quickly found was that you might copy the region to compare but then so many editing commands will add to the kill-ring, so I might want to make that part of the process interactive.

This one is probably pretty niche but it was a noticeable improvement in my workflow, so I thought I'd share. I sometimes have to fill out forms I get in PDF but that aren't fillable PDFs, merely scans of paper forms. I guess a reasonable person would install The Gimp or something like that, but I fill them out in LaTeX, using `\includegraphics` for the PDF form, and the `textpos` package to place text on top of it. 

This is requires giving the coordinates you want the text placed at, which I used to do by trial and error. And as much as I normally dislike the mouse, I had to admit that for specifying a point in an image it is a much better input device than the keyboard. So I decided to write a function that would let me click on a point in a PDF and insert the coordinates in centimeters at point in the current buffer. Writing it was fairly easy and I think really illustrates the power of a system like Emacs, a Lisp Machine or Smalltalk, where you can instantly find the source code implementing any given functionality. I knew that `pdf-tools` must contain some code to translate mouse clicks into PDF document coordinates, because it lets you place annotations by clicking. I have the text annotation function bound to `a t`, and quick `C-h k` later I was reading the source code. And after that writing the following function was pretty easy:

```elisp
(defun insert-coordinates ()
  "Insert coordinates (in centimeters) of mouse click."
  (interactive)
  (let ((pos (event-start (pdf-util-read-click-event "Click on PDF"))))
    (insert
     (with-selected-window (posn-window pos)
       (let ((pt (pdf-util-scale-pixel-to-points (posn-object-x-y pos))))
         (cl-flet ((f (x) (* 2.54 (/ x 72.0))))
           (format "(%.1fcm,%.1fcm)" (f (car pt)) (f (cdr pt)))))))))
```

Recently I started getting annoyed by a new phenomenon: Messages sent to the echo area would only persist for a second or less before disappearing.

I tracked the problem down to the Slack package, where a timer callback was doing `(message "")` regularly.  The context suggested this was meant to erase transient messages like "so-and-so is typing...", but it was happening all the time.  I didn't see any clear way to prevent that timer callback from sending an empty message, so...

```elisp
(defun empty-slack-message-p (format &rest args)
  (and (string= format "")
       (catch 'slack
         (mapbacktrace
          (lambda (_ f _ _)
            (when (and (symbolp f) (string-match-p "slack-" (symbol-name f)))
              (throw 'slack t)))))))

(advice-add 'message :before-until #'empty-slack-message-p)

```
I hadn't known about `mapbacktrace` before.  Handy!

* if you press it on a `for`/`if`/`else`/`switch` (no matter where the cursor is on the line) it will put `{`, an empty line and `}`, and will move the cursor into the body
* if you press it on a `struct`/`class`, it's similar to the previous case, but it puts a closing semicolon too.
* otherwise it will put a `;`, and a newline
* if the `{`, `;` or an empty line is already there, it won't put them again
* In comments, it will put an indented line, without continuing the comment (I configured my RET to continue commenting, so I use M-RET when I want to close the comment)

It is useful with smartparens, because you don't have to skip the closing `)` all the time. For example, if you start writing an `if` (cursor is `|`, the closing `)` was put by smartparens):

```elisp
if (expr|)

```
Then press M-RET, this will be the result:

```elisp
if (expr) {
    |
}

```
Since I created this function I use it all the time, I almost never press `{` `}` or `;`.

At function signatures, it cannot figure out whether you want to create a declaration (closed by `;`) or definition (closed by `{ }`), so it puts a `;`. And the function has a parameter (`force-curly`) with which you can force putting a`{` (I mapped this to M-S-return).

Here's the code, maybe there can be a lot of improvements:

```elisp
(defun my-cc-mode-M-RET-context (force-curly)
  (let ((c
         (if force-curly 'curly
           (let ((s (syntax-ppss)))

For some this will be obvious, but I'm sure there will be at least one person who will find this useful. One of the most amazing features of Emacs to me is dabbrev-expand, by default bound to M-/. 

> Expand previous word "dynamically".

> Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.
I> ifno suitable preceding word is found, words following point are
considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the
> buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable

This command is essentially omni-autocomplete. Chances are, the term you're trying to complete is in the buffer you're using or another buffer, and you can hit multiple times to cycle through different completions. I find the expander to be quicker and more deterministic than language autocomplete about 70% of the time. It's especially useful in writing, if you use Emacs for things other than programming, as you can complete proper names and specalized vocabulary quickly.

Is there a package similar to wdired or wgrep that would work on magit diffs? 

Particular use cases I have in mind are:

1. You've prepared a commit for pull request and during review someone spotted a mistake that's present in multiple files of that commit. Usually I grep the mistake and edit only affected files with wgrep (there might be some arbitrary reason to not fix similar issue in files not present in the commit).
2. In C++ it happens sometimes that you want to separate declaration and definition and in your commit you forgot to move some definitions to .cpp.
Usually I switch to `foobar.hpp`, kill the necessary part, switch to `foobar.cpp`, yank that part.

Have multiple machines where some things are available and other aren't?

`when-available` takes a function name and if it exists, executes the rest.

```elisp
(defmacro when-available (func cmd)
  "Execute CMD if FUNC exists as a function."
  `(when (fboundp ,func) ,cmd))

```
So you can deal with different environments.

I mostly use this for things that are nice to have, but aren't required and don't need to be installed if they aren't already.

Little quality of life improvement if you work with multiple eshell buffers:

If you write Lisp, there's a couple of old Emacs commands to help you write code while keeping parenthesis balanced: `M-(` (`insert-parenthesis`), and `M-)` (`move-past-close-and-reindent`). They used to be documented in old Emacs manuals, but presumably their description was removed to make room for other content.

With a prefix argument, `M-(` wraps in parenthesis that number of sexps. For example with point represented as "*":

*foo -> C-u 1 M-( -> (foo)

There's more information in EmacsWiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InsertPair

This one is a life changer! Use `(setq set-mark-command-repeat-pop t)` so after pressing `C-u C-SPC` to jump to a mark popped off the local mark ring, you can just keeping pressing `C-SPC` to repeat! (It's like repeatedly running `repeat` with `C-x z z z z ...`).

I learned this from [Tony Ballantyne's blog](https://tech.tonyballantyne.com/emacs/workout/evil-emacs-1/).

Apparently, the `&c.` in the title is an abbreviation of the abbreviation `etc.`, which is fine except that the sidebar's link to past threads of this kind is in fact a link to a reddit search which includes as a search term `etc.` but not `&c.`, so this thread will not show up.

# 27.1 do GC if no frame has focus

I am porting my [config](https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/dotfiles) from 26.3 to 27.1, which had the tweak to do GC whenever a frame loses focus, originally from [MatthewZMD's config](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d) I think:
```elisp
(add-hook 'focus-out-hook #'garbage-collect)
```elisp
27.1 NEWS say more generic (and more correct) `after-focus-change-function` should be used instead. Which pointed out that I do not want to GC on just any frame going out of focus, if another frame is being focused instead. It might be a better idea to GC if no frames at all are focused. Somewhat surprisingly I was not able to find any public dotfiles repo implementing this to copy paste from, so I tried to write my own:
```elisp
(defun dotfiles--gc-on-last-frame-out-of-focus ()
  "GC if all frames are inactive."
  (if (seq-every-p #'null (mapcar #'frame-focus-state (frame-list)))
  (garbage-collect)))

(add-function :after after-focus-change-function
          #'dotfiles--gc-on-last-frame-out-of-focus)
```

Very nice post!  Although I certainly do not deserve to be named in the company of such pillars of the community as Sacha, John, and Nicolas.

You should consider starting a "real" blog to host these more permanently (or more personally and visibly, at least).  I often find myself reading blog posts from a few years ago about Emacs/Org, but old Reddit posts like this are probably more likely to fade into obscurity.  Then you can write a blog post about blogging with Emacs/Org!  ;)  You could also then submit it to Planet Emacs for syndication.  Kaushal Modi has set up a beautiful blog with Org and Hugo, so you might use it as an example.

Thanks for sharing your insights!

I've been adding a ton of new words to my noun list, and the package `define-word` has been excellent for checking whether a word on that list really is a noun or not. It has `define-word-at-point` which fetches definitions from the web and displays it in the minibuffer.

Those weird keys like C-m that actually send other keys like RETURN? From our terminal days?

You can convince GUI Emacs to let you bind them, which opens up a whole slew of new easy-to-reach keybindings.

When I pretty-print JSON, I prefer to have arrays of numbers printed all on one line:

```elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'json
  (defun encode-json-array-of-numbers-on-one-line (encode array)
    (let* ((json-encoding-pretty-print
            (and json-encoding-pretty-print
                 (not (loop for x across array always (numberp x)))))
           (json-encoding-separator (if json-encoding-pretty-print "," ", ")))
      (funcall encode array)))
  (advice-add 'json-encode-array :around #'encode-json-array-of-numbers-on-one-line))

```
Before adding the advice. `(json-encode '((foo . [1 2 3]) (bar . [3 4 5])))` produces:

```elisp
{
  "foo": [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "bar": [
    3,
    4,
    5
  ]
}

```
After:

```elisp
{
  "foo": [1, 2, 3],
  "bar": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

I was watching some Lisp Machine demos on youtube a few weeks ago, and I observed that pressing ")" in the REPL causes the expression to be evaluated immediately if the expression is complete. There is no need to press `enter` at the end of the expression to submit it. I wanted my Emacs to do that as well, so I cooked up the following thing: [electric-paren](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/electric-paren.el)

It works in inferior-lisp-mode, ielm, slime, and, my favorite of all, eshell.

I just started using mu4e and wanted to have some visual indication of which account was associated with each email. Did this quickly but it seems to work well. This is akin to what K9 mail does on android.

The names "account1" refer to the folders in your Maildir for each account, i.e., \~/Maildir/account1

```elisp
(setq x-mu4e-account-colors '(("account1" . "orange")

(setq x-mu4e-account-colors-prefix "    ")

I work in a big monorepo and depend on `projectile` for navigation by adding `.projectile` files here and there, in subdirectories that I consider "projects". However there are some directories that e.g. contain libraries. If I want to work on all of them for e.g. refactoring, going into a project then locks me in that (I mean `projectile-find-file`) and I have to manually go into another project. Also I flood my projectile cache with little things that I might not use a lot. What I did was add some logic to create temporary root directories for projects, where I can then use `counsel-file-jump` and `counsel-ag`. I have some keybindings and with a prefix argument I am prompted to change the temp root. Here's the code:
```elisp
(defvar my/temp-project-root nil)

(defun my/get-or-set-temp-root (reset)
  (let* ((reset-root (if reset my/temp-project-root nil))
     (root
      (if (or reset
              (null my/temp-project-root)
              (not (file-directory-p my/temp-project-root)))
          (read-directory-name "Temp root dir: " reset-root)
        my/temp-project-root)))
(setq my/temp-project-root root)))

(defun my/counsel-file-jump-temp-root (reset)
  (interactive "P")
  (my/get-or-set-temp-root reset)
  (let ((current-prefix-arg nil))
(counsel-file-jump nil my/temp-project-root)))

(defun my/counsel-ag-temp-root (reset)
  (interactive "P")
  (my/get-or-set-temp-root reset)
  (let ((current-prefix-arg nil))
(counsel-ag "" my/temp-project-root)))
```
Also `counsel-file-jump` is so good

I find it pretty useful (for debugging etc) to override the default projectile mode line indicator and show the projectile project type of the buffer instead, which can be done pretty easily if you're a use-package user with https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/delight.html:

```elisp
(use-package projectile
  :delight '(:eval (format " P[%s]" (projectile-project-type)))
  :config
  (setq foo "bar"))
```

Setting up **org-mode LaTeX export configuration** will be much easier, if you include a `*.tex` file with your settings. like so:

```elisp
(setq org-latex-classes '(("mydocclass"
                           "\\input{my-org-template.tex}"                ;; <---- HERE --
                           ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                           ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                           ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                           ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                           ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}"))))

```
The `my-org-template.tex` has to be located where LaTeX can find it. (i.e in directory `$HOME/texmf/tex/`)

Content of the file can be all things you normaly have to define before the `\begin{document}` statement in a tex document.

Creating a nice LaTeX export theme that way, is much more convenient, debugable and robust.

I hope to see some cool org-LaTeX-export themes popping up. Imagine custom headers and footers with logos and stuff. ;)

An early WIP of a perspective-like buffer grouper/switcher based on automatically grouping buffers by recursive grouping rules written by the user: https://github.com/alphapapa/buffer-groups.el  Defining the grouping rules looks like this:

```elisp
(setf buffer-groups-groups
      (buffer-groups-defgroups
        (group (dir "~/org")
               (auto-indirect))
        (group (dir buffer-groups-emacs-source-directory))
        (group (auto-special))
        (group (mode-match "*Helm*" (rx bos "helm-")))
        (auto-project)))

```
It's based on code from https://github.com/alphapapa/sbuffer.el, which should hit MELPA soon.

>From a structural point of view, I use a single file for my contacts using several sub-headers to sort these contacts according to family, friends, colleagues, etc.

This headings structure is simple but it may limit each entry to 1 group only. What do you think about using tags for grouping?

In this way, each contact may be in N groups. This also means that they are easy to filter, or you could send a mail to a while group with 1 tag...

I guess if no one has learned yet, you can create external shell scripts for Emacs with having just

```elisp
!#/usr/bin/env bash
":"; exec emacs --script "$0" -- "$@"

```
At the top of a script and any elisp code you write under that will be ran when you run the script.

I don't know many fancier things to do with it than that. Some people probably know more.

I think it's neat you can make use of Awk scripts with org-babel.

With learning Assembly, I used it to grab all the system calls from `/usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h`

```elisp
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gawk '{$1=" "; print substr($2, 6, $NF) " " $3}' /usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h
#+END_SRC

```
Granted the output isn't really fancy, but it works.

Org mode is amazing. I was looking for a way to move an item from a plain list to another heading in the same file. Here's what I wrote, it's working well for me. Requires the ivy package.

Use the header line to show the mode line's information:

```elisp
(setq-default header-line-format mode-line-format
              mode-line-format nil)

```

This doesn't work everywhere e.g., some major modes need manipulate the header line for their own use.

If you call `occur` with a numeric prefix argument it provides lines of context around each match: if the number is positive it provides that many lines before and after each match, if it is negative, it provides that many lines before each match (in absolute value).

And if you call `occur` with the universal prefix argument, `C-u`, it does something slightly different: it prompts you for a regexp as usual, but instead of collecting entire lines containing matches for the regexp, it collects either matches of the regexp (if it contains no captures), or it prompts you for a replace-like string to format each regexp match (where you can use the capture groups).

For example, I can easily get a list of the packages I configure in my init file with:

```elisp
C-u M-s o (use-package \(\S-+\) RET \1 RET

```
The `\1` is even there by default, so really only `RET` is needed in this case.

**EDIT**: I previously had the regexp `(use-package \(\<.*?\>\)`, which as u/Bodertz pointed out, doesn't do what I want.

I use `mu4e` as email client. I guess that it is common to send some email to later discover that you forgot the attachment.

I had previously written a function to replace org-beginning-of-line to behave this way, but later found `org-special-ctrl-a/e` which does exactly what I wanted for C-a (and C-e). The default behavior drove me crazy and I didn't know there was a built-in fix. 

```elisp
 "Non-nil means `C-a' and `C-e' behave specially in headlines and items. When t, `C-a' will bring back the cursor to the beginning of the headline text, i.e. after the stars and after a possible TODO keyword.  In an item, this will be the position after bullet and check-box, if any.  When the cursor is already at that position,another `C-a' will bring it to the beginning of the line.`C-e' will jump to the end of the headline, ignoring the presence of tags in the headline.  A second `C-e' will then jump to the true end of the line, after any tags.  This also means that, when this variable is non-nil, `C-e' also will never jump beyond the end of the heading of a folded section, i.e. not after the ellipses.When set to the symbol `reversed', the first `C-a' or `C-e' works normally, going to the true line boundary first.  Only a directly following, identical keypress will bring the cursor to the special positions.This may also be a cons cell where the behavior for `C-a' and`C-e' is set separately.

I like being able to switch projects quickly, and I'm too lazy to choose a specific file after selecting which project to switch to, so I did this:

```elisp
(defun lw-switch-project ()

(let* ((projects (projectile-relevant-known-projects))
       (project (f-expand (completing-read "Switch to project: " projects)))
       (windows (window-list))
       (opened-files (projectile-project-buffers project))
       (all-files (if (> (length windows) (length opened-files))
                      (append
                       opened-files
                       (--> (projectile-project-files project)
                         (-take (- (length windows)(length opened-files)) it)
                         (-map (-partial #'f-join project) it)
                         (-map #'find-file-noselect it)))
                    opened-files)))
  (--each (-zip windows all-files)
    (set-window-buffer (car it) (cdr it)))))

```
A little verbose, but basically it prompts for a projectile project, then fills all open windows with recent project files, preferring already open buffers.

> Remember window configuration (2:3)

Heya so window configuration, what exactly do you want? Do you want it so when you quit emacs and start it up it saves your session? If so `(desktop-save-mode 1)` might be what you're after [(info)](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html).

Are you doing something in emacs and some how the windows got messed up? To quickly revert add (winner-mode 1) to your init.el file and using the custom key binds C-c <left key> you can revert the window to the previous state [(info)](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode).

> - Open help and/or other files at a bottom buffer

To specify a buffer for help/other files, one way is by "locking" buffers. So I use this code to lock and unlock a buffer and then in your case I would set up one more buffer so that everything will open there.

```elisp
 (defun toggle-window-dedicated ()
        "Toggle whether the current active window is dedicated or not. 
 Code founded by peterfoldi 
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29332242/is-there-a-way-to-fix-window-buffer-in-emacs-for-cider-error-repl/33082302#33082302"
   (interactive)
   (message 
    (if (let (window (get-buffer-window (current-buffer)))
      (set-window-dedicated-p window 
                      (not (window-dedicated-p window))))
        "Window '%s' is dedicated"
      "Window '%s' is normal")
    (current-buffer)))

```
The help/pop up are annoying, and I think a hard problem to get right.

To make emacs stop doing #files# or files~ I use a piece of code provided by [Jorgen Sch√§fer](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/33/put-all-backups-into-one-backup-folder). Something to note #files# are autosave files as in files in which a copy that you haven't saved yet (so if emacs crashes your work can be recovered). If you save your file these will go away naturally. While files~ are actual backup files.

I posted this in the emacsclient thread, but I think it deserves to live here as well:


The emacsclient / server system is great.  If you have it listening on tcp and port forward that when connecting to remote machine it adds another level of power.

I use [emacs-vterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) for a terminal inside emacs, so I've got a lot of commands remapped.  Like `man` runs `emacsclient ... man ..`, which opens the man page in the "other" buffer, so it doesn't interrupt my flow.  I use "scroll-other-window" to navigate the man page while I still have my prompt. `magit`, `dired`, and others map to their `emacsclient` equivalents.

I've written wrapper script for e/emacs client that I've come to call `e`, because it saves keystrokes

#### [The full repo is here e-emacs.sh](https://gitlab.com/zackallison/e-emacs/)

It does the standard things you would expect, starts emacs if it's not already started, open a file in a new buffer / window / terminal and optionally wait for you to finish or have the shell continue.

Then I added some functions that I found useful, starting with piping results from a command into an emacs buffer, such as `find . -name foo\* | e`.  Naturally after that was piping from a buffer to a command: `e [file] | rot13` super secure encryption.  And of course piping into and out of a buffer works as well `find . -name incriminating-evidence\* | e | xargs rm`, so you can verify / tweak the results before passing them through.  Maybe you want to leave the evidence on Two Time Tommy.  Who knows.

The other nice feature is the ability to use templates.  For example to edit a HTTP request and then send it to a server you can do that: `e -t header_template.txt | nc www.example.com 80`  The template file is copied to a temp file which is the one that is edited.

Or the poor man's blog system: `e -t header_template.html body_template.html footer.html > new_page.html`

See the repo for more examples and to download.  The notes of getting it working on remote machines aren't the cleanest.  If you have any suggestions or features that would make your life easier let me know; submit an issue or comment here.

I used EDebug for the first time this week to solve an annoying problem, it was pretty easy.

I was having trouble understanding why Projectile was not detecting the type of my project and I was getting sick of Google and StackOverflow, and I decided to just cut the crap and look at exactly what was going on by stepping through program execution.

1. Navigate to the ELisp source file (e.g. `~/.emacs.d/projectile/projectile.el`)
2. Add instrumentation to a function by cursoring-over to the start of the `defun` and do `C-u C-M-x`. (When you are done debugging, do `C-M-x` [no preceeding `C-u`] on the `defun` to remove instrumentation).
3. Do something to trigger the function call, the EDebug window pops up automatically.
4. Press the spacebar key to step through evaluation of every S-expression.
5. After evaluation of each S-expression returns, the value returned is displayed in the echo area (I like to keep the `*Messages*` buffer open in a split screen to see the log of returned values).

----

Although I can't yet solve the problem, I was able to figure out that Projectile was skipping past my `.cabal` file (which should have denoted the top-level of my Haskell project), and instead it is going all the way up to the project root for the entire application where the `.git` directory resides. The Git top-level contains a bunch of submodules but there is no single over-arching build script at that level, so Projectile gives up and returns a "generic" project type and fails to build my Haskell project.

I am trying figure out the canonical way of making the `projectile-detect-project-type` function to stop stepping up the directory hierarchy as soon as it sees the `.cabal` file, so if anyone can suggest something for me to do, please let me know.

I wanted to be able to expand yasnippets within other yasnippets (so here tab would jump to the next position instead of trying to expand snippet), surprisingly all I had to do was:

`:bind ("C-<tab>" . yas-expand)`

So C-<tab> expands a snippet within a snippet, and everything just worked as I'd hoped.  Once I'm done with the nested expansion <TAB> just moves on to the outer one. \*shrug\*

I sometimes want to pick a random choice from a long org-mode checkbox list from among those items not already checked.  I recently whipped up a little helper function for that:

```elisp

  (let ((n 0)
        (selected nil))
    (while (search-forward-regexp (rx point "- [" (group nonl) "]" (+ nonl) "\n") nil t)
      (when (and (string= " " (match-string 1)) (zerop (random (setq n (1+ n)))))
        (setq selected (match-beginning 0))))
    (if selected
        (goto-char selected)
      (error "No unfinished choice found"))))
```

Here is how you can calculate how many times larger an objects shadow is at solar noon. I was surprised to see how many quality functions related to astronomical calculations come with Emacs.

```elisp
(require 'solar)
(defun height-of-sun-at-noon (date)
"Calculates the height of at solar noon on DATE as '(M D YYYY)."
  (let* ((exact-local-noon (solar-exact-local-noon date))
		 (t0 (solar-julian-ut-centuries (car exact-local-noon)))
		 (ut (cadr exact-local-noon))
		 (hnoon (solar-horizontal-coordinates (list t0 ut)
		  (calendar-latitude)
		  (calendar-longitude) t)))
	hnoon))

(defun deg-to-rad (x)
  "Convert X from radians to degrees."
  (/ (* x float-pi) 180))

(defun length-of-shadow-at-noon (date)
  "Calculates the relative length of an objects shadow at solar noon on DATE."
  (let ((hn (cadr (height-of-sun-at-noon date))))
	(/ 1 (tan (deg-to-rad hn)))))
```

After starting a long running `find-dired` process I was looking for a way to notify me when it's done. Usually you would use a process sentinel but I though about a more general solution to this, because I always want to get notified globally whenever such a process changes its status. Enter variable watchers:

```elisp
(add-variable-watcher
 'mode-line-process
 (defun inform-about-processes (symbol newval operation where)
   (when (and (eq operation 'set)
              where)
     (call-process "notify-send" nil nil nil
                   "-t" "0"
                   "-i" "emacs"
                   (format "Process status in buffer %s changed to %s."
                           where
                           (format-mode-line newval))))))

```
The above depends on the fact that the code dealing with the process modifies the variable `mode-line-process` but I think most built in ones do that.

I'm a big fan of [alphapapa/org-protocol-capture-html](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-protocol-capture-html) (using pandoc to translate webpage as Org tree) and [abo-abo/org-download](https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download) (save screenshot, download image). They help me archive Internet contents conveniently. 

The only inconvenience I had with `org-protocol-capture-html` is that it doesn't download images automatically. In the resulting subtree, I still see raw image links. So I wrote this little function to download all images under an Org subtree. 

```elisp
(defun search-forward-and-org-download-images()
  "Search forward for HTTP Image URLs, replace each using
org-download-image to obtain a local copy."
  (interactive)
  (while (re-search-forward org-bracket-link-regexp nil t)
    (let* (
           (end (match-end 0))
           (beg (match-beginning 0))
           (s (buffer-substring-no-properties beg end))
           (match? (string-match org-bracket-link-regexp s))
           (link (match-string 1 s))
           )
      (when (string-match "^http.*?\\.\\(?:png\\|jpg\\|jpeg\\)\\(.*\\)$"
                          link) ;; This is an image link
        (message (concat "Downloading image: "link))
        (delete-region beg end)
        (org-download-image link)
        (sleep-for 1) ;; Some sites dislike frequent requests
        ))))

```
Now I can one click and archive web contents easily. I find it more pleasurable reading experience, and it gives me the peace of mind to have a local copy. Note: It doesn't handle relative link yet, and there's no error handling, so use with cautions

1. You can just go to the value of `isearch-other-end`, which is the buffer position of the start of the last (i.e. current) search hit. E.g., `(goto-char isearch-other-end)` instead of doing `(isearch-repeat 'backward)` (when searching forward).

2. It's generally better to use `push-mark`, and then end your command with `(setq deactivate-mark  nil)`, rather than use

```elisp
     (let ((current-prefix-arg '(4)))
       (call-interactively 'set-mark-command))
```

I spent the past week cleaning up my Emacs init files and I bumped into this little gem.  I call it "ZSH man page search mode" because it was the place that I first needed it.

I do `M-x man zshall(1)` fairly frequently (and don't forget to `widen` so you can see all of the pages).  Then I would start searching for what I was looking for.  The man page is nicely structured so if I wanted to find "foo", search for "foo" had too many hits.  What I wanted to find was the place where "foo" is described.

This little search does the trick.  It is probably useful for other man pages and perhaps even other places but for now... I call it "ZSH man page search"

Enjoy!

```lisp
  (defun zsh-manpage-search-regexp (string &optional lax)
"Returns a string to search for entries in the zshall man page"
(format "\n[A-Z ]*\n \\{7\\}%s%s" string (if lax "" "\\_>")))

  (isearch-define-mode-toggle zsh-manpage "z" zsh-manpage-search-regexp "\
  Searching zshall man page for where a concept is described")

This is a very simple function, but it has saved me from countless of "do I have to do _this_ again now?" moments.

When editing LaTeX files I often find myself wanting to convert inline math to display math, in order for equations to "pop out" more.  I could not find anything already implemented, so I wrote something that does this whenever the point is inside an inline math (`$`-based, sorry `\( \)` gang) environment: 

```elisp
(defun slot/inline-to-display-math ()
  "Transform inline math to display math."
  (interactive)
  (when (and (texmathp) (equal "$" (car texmathp-why))) ; inline math?
    (let* ((beg   (save-excursion (search-backward "$")))
           (end-$ (search-forward "$"))
           (end   (if (-contains? '(?. ?,) (char-after end-$))
                      (1+ end-$)    ; put punctuation into display-maths
                    end-$)))
      (kill-region beg end)
      ;; insert display math
      (TeX-newline)
      (insert "\\[")
      (TeX-newline)
      (insert-for-yank (string-replace "$" "" (current-kill 0)))
      (TeX-newline)
      (insert "\\]")
      (TeX-newline))))

```
For example, this would transform 

```elisp
The cowedge $\iota \colon P \xRightarrow{\; .. \;} C$ is easily seen to be unique up to unique isomorphism.

```
into 

```elisp
The cowedge
\[
  \iota \colon P \xRightarrow{\; .. \;} C
\]
is easily seen to be unique up to unique isomorphism.

```
I'm a bit surprised by my not finding any function to already insert some string into the simple `\[ \]`-based display math; everything I could find just inserted dollars instead.  I suppose one could insert a `displaymath` environment, but I've never like the look of that.  Oh well.

Sometimes I'm working on programs with functions a few pages long, and `follow-mode` means that I can open two windows of the same buffer side-by-side and have the text flow like a book between them. I can double or even triple the amount of lines I can view at one time.

This has largely superseded what I might have used those code-overview map things for, which is difficult anyway, since I like to use Emacs from the terminal.

It will keep the text aligned as you move through the file, and pairs well with binding `<mouse-5>` and `<mouse-4>` to the `scroll-up/down-line` commands in `xterm-mouse-mode`.

If I'm studying/notetaking, I often end up with a few Emacs-windows arranged in a vertical stack. `winner-mode` or `window-configuration-to-register` are great, but if I want to quickly regain some vertical screen-real-estate without messing up the layout, then it's pretty intuitive to use `follow-mode` and just switch multiple windows to the same buffer, now they behave like one.

**Create Rectangular Selection with Meta+Click+Drag**

By default, when you click and drag with the Meta key Emacs creates what it calls a "secondary selection" which is super interesting and useful, but not what this tip is about. In most editors (on the Mac anyway) option+click+drag is used to create a rectangular selection. Emacs, of course, supports this, you just need to remap it.

```elisp
(global-set-key [M-down-mouse-1] #'mouse-drag-region-rectangle)
(global-set-key [M-drag-mouse-1] #'ignore)
(global-set-key [M-mouse-1]      #'mouse-set-point)

```
You can also create a rectangular selection with the command `rectangle-mark-mode`.

Don't forget to bind `replace-rectangle` to something convenient for super easy editing.

(Nothing too fancy, I'm sure a lot of people have a similar thing in their toolbox, but it was useful to me again today.)

When writing elisp packages, the compiler expects that all variables and functions are declared. Declaring variables defined somewhere else is easy, one just needs to \`defvar\` them, but declaring functions should mention the file where it is defined.

Inserting all those forms is tedious, especially if the function comes from a package with several files. But emacs already knows where the function comes from, so we can just ask it.

```elisp
(defun tv/add-declare-function (fun)
  (interactive "a") 
  (let* ((buf (car (find-function-noselect fun))) 
         (name (file-name-base (buffer-file-name buf)))) 
    (insert (format "(declare-function %s "%s")\n" fun name))))

```
Call it with M-x, insert the name of the function you want to declare (with completion), and voil√†.

A tiny thing I just noticed: in `tex-mode`, you can create a new environment with `C-c C-e`. With the universal argument (`C-u C-c C-e`), however, you can easily change any environment into another.

I created an `enumerate` environment and immediately changed my mind. By chance, I intuitively tried the aforementioned command and I was instantly able to change the environment into `itemize`.

I love using `dabbrev-expand` (bound by default to `M-/`) to complete text I know is in one of my buffers. It completes one word at a time, but if you want to keep pulling subsequent words from the location where a completion is found you can insert a space and run `dabbrev-expand` again, so `SPC M-/`.

For example if you have the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" in some buffer (and say no other "qu" appears anywhere in your buffers), then `qu M-/ SPC M-/ SPC M-/` will insert "quick brown fox".

This is already great, but I find the key sequence `SPC M-/` awkward to type so I wrote this little function which I bind to `M-'`:

```elisp
(defun dabbrev-next (arg)
  "Insert the next ARG words from where previous expansion was found."
  (interactive "p")
  (dotimes (_ arg)
    (insert " ")
    (dabbrev-expand 1)))
    
```
Then for "quick grown fox" I can go `qu M-/ M-' M-'` which feels much easier to type (on my keyboard `/` and `'` are very close to each other).

(`M-'` is bound by default to `abbrev-prefix-mark` which I never use, so I didn't mind rebinding it.)

Imenu is pretty adictive and it's disappointing when some major mode doesn't support it. Luckily, it's fairly easy to cook up some regexps to provide imenu support in a new major mode. For example I recently noticed that customize buffers didn't have imenu support add I wrote this:

```elisp
(defun configure-imenu-Custom ()
  (setq imenu-generic-expression
        '(("Faces" "^\\(?:Show\\|Hide\\) \\(.*\\) face: \\[sample\\]" 1)
          ("Variables" "^\\(?:Show Value\\|Hide\\) \\([^:\n]*\\)" 1))))

(add-hook 'Custom-mode-hook #'configure-imenu-Custom)

```
One subtlety with writing this is that the customize buffers show little triangles instead of the words "Show", "Hide" or "Show Value". To figure out what text is really in the buffer you can use `C-u C-x =` which tells you about any overlays at point.

I have a custom minor-mode with a keymap. I want to enable this keymap globally so I made a globalized version of my minor-mode. However, now keys from modes which override the same keys as my keymap do not work anymore. How do I make my globalized minor-mode  (and its keymap) of a lower priority than other modes? I know I can modify `minor-mode-map-alist` but I am not sure how to do this without adding a hook for every mode.

Your post was a lot of text for having essentially two points:

1. You believe you need NERDTree to work.
2. You haven't found an emacs equivalent to NERDTree.

And in that text, you didn't even really cover exactly what you need from NERDTree...other than "on the side...so I can switch between lots of files".


Which isn't a lot to go on for offering you help.  Because emacs has A LOT of file/directory navigation tools, staring with the venerable `dired`:


http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryDirectories


But I'm guessing it's not the lack of navigation facilities that's frustrating you, but rather that "on the side" bit.  Which is a bit of an issue, actually...though not an insurmountable one.


It's mostly an issue because the traditional emacs way is more about buffer "juggling" than buffer "bulletin-boarding".  As a "juggler" myself, "on the side" seems like terrible waste of screen real estate, to me.  I just `C-x b` into (one of) my dired buffer(s), whenever I need to look at or switch files.


But if that's an impossible work-flow for you to learn, you can still get your "bulletin-board" mosaic of directory-navigation "on the side", with some emacs window splitting rules.   


Alas, I can't help much with that as it is a foreign (and highly undesirable) interface for a buffer juggler, like myself, so I have no experience with it.  


But there are emacs users who share your preference, who could probably provide assistance, if you could state your needs there, clearly...but I recognize that's difficult for a beginner (not enough emacs-vocabulary to know the "proper" names of features, or even knowing your preferred directory navigation tool, in emacs).


So, I think your best bet is to:

1. Take a screen-shot of your desired interface from vim/NERDTree.
2. Post that, either here, in an EDIT, or another post.  Along with a description of *exactly* what in the screenshot you feel you need to work.
3. Ask how that can be achieved in emacs.


...and you'll probably get better results that merely posting your frustrations that emacs isn't exactly like $OTHER_EDITOR.
